                <p>Nothing makes a webpage feel like more of a product and less of a project than changing from the default
                    fonts. You should have chosen one or two fonts when you were putting the site plan together for your
                    site. Go review that now.</p>
                <p>If you chose fonts from among the
                    <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp" target="_blank">web-safe list</a>&nbsp;then you can use them just like Khan academy showed you this week. (Here is another
                    list of the web-safe fonts:&nbsp;
                    <a href="http://www.cssfontstack.com/" target="_blank">http://www.cssfontstack.com/</a>)</p>
                <p>If you chose fonts from Google Fonts or elsewhere then we have to make the font available to the web page
                    first before we can use them.</p>
                <p>No matter which fonts you are using it is always a good idea to list some fall-back fonts, in case for some
                    reason your first choice doesn't work correctly...you can control how it degrades. Your second choice
                    should be similar to your first (and usually web-safe), the third font in the list should usually be
                    one of the default font families. (serif, san-serif, fantasy, monospace, or script)</p>
                <p>So for example if I chose Helvetica&nbsp;as my font for body copy I would add something like&nbsp;
                    <kbd>font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;</kbd>&nbsp;to a rule modifying the&nbsp;
                    <kbd>body</kbd> of my page.</p>
                <p>If however I wanted to use the font Rock Salt for my headlines, that is not a web safe font and will probably
                    not be on most computers. I have to do an extra step to make it available.</p>
          <p>
            Google Fonts makes it very easy to add your fonts. Find your font in
            Google Fonts and click it: 
          </p>
          <div class="fig-block">
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../images/google_font_1.png"
                alt="googlefont"
                title="googlefont"
              />
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>
            Then click on the 'Select this style' to expand it. 
          </p>
          <div class="fig-block">
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../images/google_font_2.png"
                alt="googlefont2"
                title="googlefont2"
              />
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>
            Then click on the 'Embed' tab and the '@import' tab.
          </p>
          <div class="fig-block">
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../images/google_font_3.png"
                alt="googlefont2"
                title="googlefont2"
              />
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>
            Copy the line that starts with '@import' and add it to the
            <strong>top</strong> of your <kbd>style.css</kbd> file. It should
            look something like this:
          </p>
                <pre><code class="html">
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My first website&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;style&gt;
          @import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Rock+Salt);
           ...            
</code></pre>

                <p>Now you can use that font just like normal, ie:&nbsp;
                    <kbd>font-family: 'Rock Salt', cursive;</kbd>
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Step 01</h3>
            <p>Based on your font choices from your site plan, add the appropriate&nbsp;
                <kbd>font-family:</kbd>, and&nbsp;
                <kbd>@import</kbd>&nbsp;lines to your CSS to change the body font and headline font on your webpage.</p>
            <h3>Step 02</h3>
            <p>Often the default font sizes are fine...but there are times when they need to be changed. For example it's good
                for the links used for navigation to be nice and easy to click, so lets increase their size. Let's make it
                110% of normal. (Remember the 'em' unit of measurement for fonts. 1em = the normal size of your font...so
                1.1em = 110%)</p>
            <div class="callout" style="overflow:auto;">
                <img src="../images/paddingexample.jpg" alt="paddingexample" title="paddingexample" class="right" />
                <p>Nice to have those fonts in there :) Now though notice what is happening anywhere that you have made colored
                    boxes around anything. Here is an example:</p>
                <p>The font and image are pressed right up against the edge of the border and it looks...not great. Lets fix
                    it.</p>
                <p>The space between the content in a box and the edge of a box is called
                    <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_padding.asp"
                        target="_blank">padding</a>. We can add padding to one or all sides. for example if I wanted to add some padding to all
                    4 sides of the box I would do something like this:&nbsp;
                    <kbd>padding: 1em;</kbd>&nbsp;(We will learn more about padding next week)</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Step 03</h3>
            <p>Use
                <kbd>padding</kbd> to space out the content on your page from any edges or borders where it is needed.</p>
            <h3>Step 04</h3>
            <p>Proximity is a design principle that we rely on to help to know which elements on our page are related to each
                other by their distance from each other. Let's make sure that visitors to our site know that the headlines
                and paragraphs are related to each other by bringing them a little closer together. (The default spacing
                has them just a little far apart.) Adjust the&nbsp;
                <kbd>line-height</kbd>&nbsp; and
                <kbd>margin</kbd>s of your headlines to bring them closer to the paragraphs they belong to. You could even play
                with the line-height of your paragraphs to see how it affects readability as well.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>If you are having a hard time getting your headlines to come closer to your paragraphs try this: right click
                    on one of your headlines and select "Inspect". An area on your browser should open at either the side
                    or bottom of the screen that shows both the html and the styles for that element. This is a powerful
                    tool.</p>
                <p>When I did this I saw the following:</p>
                <div class="fig-block">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../images/inspect.jpg" alt="inspect element example" />
                    </figure>

                </div>
                <ol>
                    <li>Notice that browser is showing me the size of the element in pixels.</li>
                    <li>It's also showing me the area it takes up both for size (blue highlight) and margins (brown highlight).
                        If there were any padding it would be green.</li>
                    <li>All the styles are shown. The third arrow shows styles I defined.</li>
                    <li>The last arrow shows several styles I
                        <strong>did not</strong> define. Notice it says "user agent stylesheet" That's just another way of saying
                        "browser default styling".</li>
                </ol>
                <figure class="right">
                    <img src="../images/box-model.jpg" alt="box model example" />
                    <figcaption>Box Model for the element</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The highlighted area and the styles are both showing in different ways that
                    <kbd>&lt;h2&gt;</kbd> has top and bottom margins defined by default. Those defaults are probably interfering
                    with your desire to move the headline closer to the paragraph.</p>

                <p>Another way of seeing this can be found if you scroll down in the area showing the styles...you should see
                    something like in the Box model figure.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>If you refer back to the wireframe you will notice that the paragraphs in each of the sections only take
                    up about half the screen. Let's make them do that now. We can use the&nbsp;
                    <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_width.asp"
                        target="_blank">width</a>&nbsp;property again to do this. You should have placed the headline and paragraph together
                    in a box and given it a class to identify it. If you didn't do that now. My code looks like this:</p>
                <div class="fig-block">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../images/codeexample.jpg" alt="codeexample" title="codeexample" />
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>It might be helpful to review the&nbsp;
                    <a href="../images/wireframe-boxes.jpg" target="_blank">wireframe</a>&nbsp;I am basing my page on. Notice how I have grouped and identified things. I placed
                    the headline, and paragraph in the first section (top-row) in a &lt;div&gt; with a class of leftcol,
                    then I use that same class for the left column in the second section (middle-row). Then I did the same
                    thing for the content that will be in the right column (once we learn positioning). This was part of
                    last week's assignment.</p>
                <p>If yours doesn't look similar to this you might want to adjust it. Layout will go much easier if your HTML
                    is well structured. Think of a body and skeleton. If the bones in your elbows bent backwards instead
                    of forwards you could scratch your own back easily, but you would have a really hard time eating :) You
                    could get it done, but it's better to have a structure that makes it easy. Poor HTML structure will make
                    positioning and laying out your site&nbsp;
                    <strong>much</strong>&nbsp;more work.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Step 05</h3>
            <p>Review your wireframe and set widths for elements that need it. In my example I would set a width of 48% on the
                left and right columns, and bottom section to constrain them to a bit less than half the space they have
                available.</p>
            <h3>Step 06</h3>
            <p>Open your website&nbsp;into your browser to make sure the web page displays correctly. Pay special attention
                to whether your images are all displaying. Once verified, submit the URL for your page to iLearn.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Make sure to
                <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">validate</a> your page as well and fix any errors that show.</p>
            <h2>Grading</h2>
            <p>This activity will be graded using the following rubric:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Linked site shows examples of using font-family, font-size, line-height, width, and padding with classes
                    or ids (6 pts)</li>
                <li>Fonts of the webpage are changed from the default browser font and a series of 3 fonts have been indicated
                    in the CSS to control how the font degrades if a desired font is not available. (3pts)</li>
                <li>The HTML is well formed and without errors. (1 pt)</li>
            </ul>
