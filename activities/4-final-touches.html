          We have made a lot of improvements to our page over the last few
          weeks. This week we finally take on the layout. After we finish the
          layout of our page it should look very similar to the wireframe, and
          will be close to complete.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">

            The instructions below are expecting a certain structure in your
            HTML to work. If you followed the instructions in the
            <a href="1-getting-started.html" target="_blank">Getting Started</a>
            activity you should have it. It should look similar to the
            following:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="lang-markup">
&lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div class="banner-box"&gt;
        &lt;img src="river-wide.JPG" alt="wide shot of the salmon river"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="home-grid"&gt;
        &lt;h2 class="home-headline-1"&gt;We run Rivers to relax.&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p class="home-paragraph-1"&gt;We believe...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="home-right-img"&gt;
            &lt;img src="river-evening.jpg" alt="peaceful evening shot of a river"&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h2 class="home-headline-2"&gt;We run Whitewater for the Rush.&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p class="home-paragraph-2"&gt;That doesn't mean...&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;img src="river-narrow.jpg" alt="river flowing through a canyon"&gt;

        &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/main&gt;
</code> </pre>
          <p>
            Make any changes necessary to have yours match what is above. (HTML
            only...your images and text can be different)

            <h3>Banner width</h3>
            <p>
              First let's consider the banner. According to the wireframe it
              should extend all the way across the width of the page. Depending
              on which image you are using yours may or may not be doing that.
              Let's set a width of 100% on that image. Find the
              <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> that contains your banner image. You
              should have added a class calling it something like
              <kbd>banner-box</kbd>. We can use that class to apply our width.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>You might have tried something like:</p>
              <pre><code class="lang-css">.banner-box {
    width: 100%;
}                                    </code> </pre>
              <p>
                to set the banner width. If you did you will find that it didn't
                work! Why not? Well...that would apply the width to the element
                with the class of <kbd>banner-box</kbd>. Guess what? As a
                <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> it already had a width of 100%! What we
                need to do is apply the width to the image <em>inside</em> of
                the element with the class of <kbd>banner-box</kbd>. Does that
                make sense? We can do that by changing our selector slightly:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-css">.banner-box img {
    width: 100%;
}                        </code></pre>
            </div>
          </li>

            <h3>Visualizing the Grid</h3>
            <p>
              Now let's tackle the main portion of the site. We will be using
              the CSS Grid you learned last week to accomplish this. The first
              step is to look at the
              <a
                href="../images/wireframe-grid-column-lines.png"
                target="_blank"
                >wireframe</a
              >
              and see if we can visualize how a grid (columns and rows) would
              fit around the elements on the page. Open it up, you may even want
              to print it out and draw some lines on it.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                In case your powers of visualization are a bit rusty...you can
                see my result below for the columns.
              </p>
              <section class="hint">
                <input type="checkbox" />
                <h4>Wireframe with Gridlines</h4>
                <i></i>
                <div>
                  <div class="fig-block">
                    <figure>
                      <img
                        alt="Wireframe with gridlines"
                        src="../images/wireframe-grid-column-lines.png"
                        title="Wireframe with gridlines"
                      />
                    </figure>
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    Notice how I used 5 equal columns...and each element can be
                    fit in one or more columns.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </section>

              <p>And here is another image showing columns, rows, and gaps.</p>
              <section class="hint">
                <input type="checkbox" />
                <h4>Layout with Grid lines</h4>
                <i></i>
                <div>
                  <div class="fig-block">
                    <figure>
                      <img
                        alt="Wireframe with gridlines"
                        src="../images/finished-layout-with-grid-lines.jpg"
                        title="Wireframe with gridlines"
                      />
                    </figure>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </section>
              <p>
                After you have a good idea of what the grid needs to look like
                (numbers and sizes of rows and columns), either by figuring it
                out on your own or by reviewing the two images above, continue
                on to the next step.
              </p>

            <!-- start step -->
            <h3>Defining the Grid</h3>
            <p>
              Let's try css grid to do this.
              <a
                href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/"
                target="_blank"
                >CSS Grid</a
              >
              (&lt;- open this link and keep it handy) is good when we have
              several elements that need to be placed into specific spots on a
              page. Before you start you may want to go review the
              <a
                href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/guide-css-layout/#grid-layout"
                target="_blank"
                >portion on Grid</a
              >
              from the article you read last week.
            </p>

            <p>
              Locate the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> inside of
              <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> that contains most of our content. You
              should have given it a class earlier like
              <kbd>home-grid</kbd> (give it that class now if you didn't
              before). If you don't already have a rule in your CSS with that
              selecter add one now. Add the following property:
              <code>display: grid;</code>, to modify that section of your page
              to turn it into a grid container. In my case that rule would look
              like the following:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">.home-grid {
    display: grid;
}    
    </code></pre>
            <p>
              Now all of the immediate children will become grid-items or
              children.
            </p>

            <p>
              Next we need to define our columns. Above you should have found
              that this layout works best with 5 equally sized columns. To
              define this in grid we use the
              <code>grid-template-columns</code> property. It is a property of
              the grid container, so we can add it to our
              <code>.home-grid</code> rule set. We don't know exactly how wide
              each column should be...only that they need to be equal. We can
              use the <kdb>fr</kdb> unit to do this. <kbd>1fr</kbd> = one equal
              portion of a space.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">.home-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}    
    </code></pre>
            <p>
              (If you remember the <code>repeat()</code> method from the Grid
              videos, you could shorten <kbd>1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr</kbd> to
              <kbd>repeat(5, 1fr)</kbd>. But either will work.)
            </p>

            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                You should see an immediate change once you define your columns.
                The browser will try to start placing items into cells. It will
                do this even though we have not yet defined any rows!
              </p>
              <h4>Explicit vs Implicit Grids</h4>
              <p>
                Grids can be constructed either <em>explicitly</em>: you define
                everything about the grid, column number and widths, row number
                and heights, and where every item should be placed, or
                <em>implicitly</em>: you let the browser make as many of the
                decisions as possible. Most grids are a mix of both. All grids
                need to have some columns defined, but after that the browsers
                will <em>implicitly</em> create rows as needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you review the 'Layout with grid lines' image above you will
                see that the rows are not all the same height. You may have been
                wondering how you are to know how big to make each row? I'll let
                you in on a little secret: you don't have to know in many cases.
                You can often let the browser figure it out!
              </p>
              <p>
                My workflow when creating a new Grid layout is usually the
                following:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Review my wireframe to begin visualizing the grid I need to
                  make.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Define columns...and then see how close I am to achieving my
                  desired layout!
                </li>
                <li>Explicitly place items <em>as needed</em></li>
                <li>Explicitly create rows <em>if needed</em></li>
                <li>Adjust alignment <em>as needed</em></li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Let the browser do as much of the work as you can is my advice!
              </p>
            </div>
            <!-- end step -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- start step -->
            <h3>Place the items</h3>
            <p>
              In our layout implicitly (automatically) created rows will be just
              fine. But most of our items will have to be explicitly placed to
              get them into the right spots. Let's place the first together.
            </p>
            <!-- placement with grid-column/grid/row -->

            <p>
              Find the first headline. It should have a class of
              <code>home-headline-1</code>, if it does not, add that class to
              it. Make a rule in your css for that class. Use the
              <kbd>grid-column</kbd> and <kbd>grid-row</kbd> properties to
              assign this item to a portion of the grid. If you review this
              <a
                href="../images/finished-layout-with-grid-lines.jpg"
                target="_blank"
                >layout image</a
              >
              again you will see that the headline is in row 1, and only needs
              one row of space. It also starts in column 1, but needs 3 columns
              of space to fit. To place it correctly in the grid you could use
              the following:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">.home-headline-1 {
    grid-column: 1 / 4;
    grid-row: 1 / 2;
}    
    </code></pre>
            <p>
              Continue placing the rest of the items into the correct
              rows/columns.
            </p>
            <!-- placement with grid-template-area -->

                            <h2>Grid-area method</h2>
                            <p>We are going to use the <kbd>grid-template-area</kbd> method of positioning our items on the grid. The first step to do this is to apply area names to each of the items. We need to create a rule for each of the grid items we need to place. Basically anything that is a <em>direct child</em> for the <kbd>home-grid</kbd> element (our grid container). When you are done you should have 7 rules defined. Each rule should look something like below:</p>
                             <pre><code class="lang-css">
              .home-headline-1 {
                  grid-area: hl-1;
              }
              </code> </pre>
                           <p>Change the selector (classname) and area name as needed. Classname should match the class we put on each element earlier in the course. Area name can be anything you want (no spaces or special characters!) but should be unique. I would try to keep them short.</p>
                           <p>Once all of our items have area names on them we can place them. Add a <kbd>grid-template-area</kbd> property to your <code>.home-grid</code> rule in your CSS.  It acts as a sort of text map of our layout. Each cell in our grid will be represented with either a dot or one of our <kbd>grid-area</kbd>s.  Below is an example with the first item placed:</p>
                            <pre><code class="lang-css">
               .home-grid {
                  display: grid;
                  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
                  grid-template-area: "hl-1 hl-1 hl-1 . ."
                                      ". . . . ."
                                      ". . . . ."
                                      ". . . . ."
                                      ". . . . ."
                                      ". . . . ."
                                      ". . . . .";
              }
              </code> </pre>
              <p>If you refer back to the layout image again you will see that the first headline starts in the first column, first row...and takes up 3 columns from there.  So we placed that <kbd>grid-area</kbd> name in those 3 spots in the template map. All of the empty cells are represented with dots. To add the first image to the layout (assuming your first image has a <kbd>grid-area: img-1</kbd>), we would change the above to the following:</p>
                                 <pre><code class="lang-css">
               .home-grid {
                  display: grid;
                  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
                  grid-template-area: "hl-1 hl-1 hl-1 img-1 img-1"
                                      ". . . img-1 img-1"
                                      ". . . . ."
                                      ". . . . ."
                                      ". . . . ."
                                      ". . . . ."
                                      ". . . . .";
              }
              </code> </pre>

                           <p>Notice that the image spans two rows as well as two columns. So we replaced <strong>four</strong> dots with the correct area name. To finish the layout replace the correct dots with your <kbd>grid-area</kbd> names.</p>
            -->
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                If your images are not resizing to fit in the box you have them
                in make sure you have the following rule in your css:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-css">img {
    max-width: 100%;
}

              <p>
                This will make sure that none of your images can ever be larger
                than the box they are in.

            <h3>Grid Gap</h3>
            <p>
              Looking good! One thing is bugging me though. The headlines and
              paragraphs are in some cases squished up against the images. If
              you refer back to the
              <a
                href="../images/finished-layout-with-grid-lines.jpg"
                target="_blank"
                >layout image</a
              >
              again you will notice some space between the columns and rows.
              This is called a <kbd>gap</kbd> and can be added with the
              <code>grid-gap</code> property. This is a property that gets
              applied to the grid container. So add a grid gap of
              <kbd>1em</kbd> to your grid.

            <h3>Navigation: Check your header HTML</h3>

            <p>
              We've done a lot of work on our site over the last few weeks and
              it's looking pretty close to that wireframe now. The next portion
              that needs our attention is the header. I have to admit I'll be
              really happy when we get that fixed up!

            <h3>Logo and navigation placement</h3>
            <p>
              Let's start with getting the logo and the list of links to line up
              in a row first. There are several ways we could do this...but
              since we are most familiar with Grid...we'll use that. This is
              really just a simple grid with one row and two columns! The only
              tricky part is identifying which element will be the Grid
              container and which are the grid items.
            </p>
            <p>
              We want to move the <kdb>nav</kdb> and
              <kdb>logo-box</kdb> elements. Their parent is the
              <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element. That is where we will start.
              Create a rule targeting the <code>header</code> in your CSS if you
              don't already have one. Add the properties to turn on grid and
              define some columns.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                How big should the columns be this time? We have a small issue.
                This time the columns will not be the same size. We know how big
                the column with the logo needs to be (the size of the
                logo...around 110px), but we don't know the size for the
                navigation! We really just want it to be whatever is left. CSS
                Grid has an option to indicate that: <kbd>auto</kbd>.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              Here is an example of how your <code>header</code> rule might
              look:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">header {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 110px auto;        
}
                </code></pre>
            <p>
              Just like that your logo and links should have moved onto the same
              row.
            </p>
            <div class="fig-block">
              <figure>
                <img
                  alt="Header Step 8"
                  src="../images/header-grid-2.png"

            <h3>Navigation link layout</h3>
            <p>
              Let's make our links flow across the page horizontally next. It's
              important to remind ourselves why they currently look the way they
              do...list items are block elements. So one way to make them flow
              horizontally would be to change them to inline-block elements
              instead...but we also saw above that Grid can be used to make
              columns act as rows as well...and we also gain some nifty
              alignment tools. Let's use that to layout our navigation. Again
              remember that for grid we need to identify the items we want to
              move around (in this case the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>), then find
              their parent (in this case the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) The parent
              is where we will put our <code>display:grid;</code> Write a CSS
              rule using a selector to <strong>only</strong> affect the list
              that is inside of a <kbd>nav</kbd> element and add that now.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                We learned about several new ways to
                <a
                  href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp"
                  target="_blank"
                  >select</a
                >
                elements with CSS previously in Khan Academy. One of them allows
                us to combine multiple selectors together. For step 1 above we
                could use a simple <kbd>ul</kbd> as our selector, but that would
                change all lists on the page, and we may not want that. It would
                be better to get <strong>only</strong> the lists that are inside
                of a <kbd>nav</kbd>. We can do that by using "
                <code>nav ul</code>" as our selector instead of just
                <code>ul</code>. Many of the steps of this activity will require
                similar selectors.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              We also need to define our columns. The easiest way to do this
              would be to count the number of items in our list, and create that
              many <kbd>1fr</kbd> sized columns. This would certainly work, but
              it is a bit rigid. If someone views our page on a smaller screen
              the links might start looking squished. What would be nicer is to
              have the browser define
              <em>as many columns as will fit in the current width</em>. There
              is actually a way to do this! Take a look at the example below
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">nav ul {
    list-style: none; /* removes the bullets! */
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(6em, 1fr));          
}
                </code></pre>
            <p>
              Let's break that down. It uses the <kbd>repeat</kbd> method, but
              instead of giving a number of columns like in the past we use the
              keyword <kbd>auto-fit</kbd>. This tells the browser to create as
              many columns as it can fit in the space available. Then instead of
              giving a specific size for each column, we used the
              <kbd>minmax</kbd> method. This tells the browser to create columns
              that are <kbd>1fr</kbd> big,
              <em>but no column can be smaller than <kbd>6em</kbd> </em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              So using a bit of math to illustrate: If we have 4 links and the
              browser window is currently <kbd>60em</kbd> (about 960px):
              <kbd>60em / 4 = 15em</kbd> this is way bigger than
              <kbd>6em</kbd> so we would get four equally sized columns (1fr) of
              <kbd>15em</kbd>. If the browser window size were only
              <kbd>20em</kbd> (around 320px) then <kbd>20em / 4 = 5em</kbd>.
              This is smaller than our minimum of <kbd>6em</kbd> so it can't fit
              all four columns. It will instead create 3 equal columns on the
              first row, and one more on a second row.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why <kbd>6em</kbd> for the minimum you may be asking? Well it was
              based on the length of my longest link (Rates/Dates). Any smaller
              than that and the words got squished. Check out the length of your
              longest links and adjust that value up or down as necessary.

            <h3>Finishing up the navigation</h3>
            <p>
              The links are moving in the right direction now...but the
              alignment isn't quite right, and the row is a bit bigger than we
              want it to be. The row is easy to fix. It's actually caused by the
              unordered list we used for our links. Lists (and many other
              elements) have some default styling that come with them. In this
              case there is some margin automatically added to the top and
              bottom of the list that is causing us problems. Let's turn it off
              by adding <code>margin: 0</code> to our <code>nav ul</code> rule.
            </p>
            <p>
              One final issue...the links are aligned at the top of the row.
              They would look better in the middle (or bottom). Vertical
              alignment for Grid items is controlled with the
              <kbd>align-items</kbd> property. We can add
              <code>align-items: center;</code> to our Grid container (in this
              case would be the <code>header</code> rule) to fix this issue.

                First is to address a usability issue. You should never make a
                user guess about what elements are links and what aren't. We
                should give them plenty of visual hints.
              </p>
              <p>
                One thing we can take advantage of is
                <a
                  href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp"
                  target="_blank"
                  >pseudo-classes</a
                >. Click on that link and look at the examples there...go
                on...I'll wait.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pseudo classes let us target specific states of elements, such
                as link. Links have 4 states: link (normal, nothing has
                happened), visited (link has been clicked on), active (link is
                currently being clicked), and hover (mouse is on link, but not
                clicking)
              </p>
              <p>
                The way we would change a link on hover is to add a rule like
                this: <kbd>a:hover { color: green; }</kbd>. This would change
                the color of all links to green on hover.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              Let's set up some hover events to let our visitors know without a
              doubt that our navbar is indeed a navbar with clickable things. My
              example is going to stay simple, but you should refer back to your
              site plan to see how you had planned to style your links.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this example we are going to simply add an underline to the
              link on hover. Add another rule to your CSS that looks like
              <kbd>nav a:hover{ }</kbd>. This will only be active when the mouse
              is on the links in our navbar. Change something about your link in
              that rule.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                There are a couple of common things that can happen when you
                mouse over a link. You could do something very simple and just
                add (or remove) an underline on hover (text-decoration: none).
                You could also change the color of the link text, or change the
                color of link and background. Refer back to your site plan or
                try a few different effects, just remember the purpose: to make
                sure the visitor knows what are links and what aren't.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="callout">
              <h3>Notice!</h3>
              <p>
                Most of the time CSS doesn't care much about spaces. You can
                have them or not. Sometimes it does care though and
                pseudo-classes are one of them. <code>nav a:hover</code> will
                work just fine... <code>nav a: hover</code> will not. Make sure
                to <strong>not</strong> add spaces around the : on your
                pseudo-selector.
              </p>
            </div>
            <!-- end step -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- start step -->
            <h3>Footer</h3>
            <p>
              The next thing to do now is to finish the footer. According to the
              wireframe the copyright should be on the left, the social media
              icons on the right, the whole footer should be 55px high, and
              there should be space around the icons. This is similar to what we
              have done before. You should be able to figure it out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Review the tips on last week's positioning activity if you get
              stuck. (Hint: there are several ways to do this, but since we have
              spent the most time with CSS Grid I would recommend using that to
              get things into the right locations. Then use
              <kbd>padding, margin, or width</kbd> on the different elements in
              the footer as needed to finish it off.)

            <h3>Enhancements</h3>
            <p>
              At this point your site is mostly done. There is much that could
              be done to dress it up a bit though. From the list below pick two
              items and follow the instructions to enhance your page.
            </p>
            <div class="fig-block">
              <figure>
                <img
                  alt="Enhancements"
                  src="../images/enchancements.jpg"
                  title="Enhancements"
                />
                <figcaption>Enhancements</figcaption>

                  >"3D" images</a
                >
              </li>

            <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
            <p>
              Nearly there. Congratulations on making it this far! Your page
              should be looking great in a the browser on your laptop. What does
              it look like on a smaller screen like a mobile phone though?
              Reduce the width of your browser window to see. The page is still
              readable...which is good, but it doesn't look great.
              <em>Responsive design</em> is a process that most web designers
              apply to their sites to make them look great on a wide variety of
              screen sizes. One of the key parts to a responsive design is a
              <kbd>@media</kbd> query. These let us change our CSS based on the
              width of the browser window and other things as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example we can make our page responsive by adding a simple
              media query to it. Add the following to the
              <strong>bottom</strong> of your CSS:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">@media screen and (max-width: 550px) { 
/* beginning of media query */
    .home-grid {
    display: block;
    }
    
/* end of media query */ 
} 
                    </code></pre>
            <p>
              This could be read: "If the max width of the screen gets smaller
              than 550px, then use this CSS instead of what you may have seen
              above". Notice that all I'm changing is turning off grid! After
              adding this, check your page again at wide and narrow widths.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are not happy with the navigation at small widths you could
              modify the rule in your media query to change it's behavior.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">.home-grid, nav ul {
    display: block;
}
                    </code></pre>
            <p>
              If you did the call to action enhancement above then you will also
              want to add the <kbd>.banner-box</kbd> selector to the media query
              rule as well:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">.home-grid, nav ul, .banner-box {
    display: block;
}
                    </code></pre>
            <!-- end step -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- start step -->
            <h3>Validate and submit</h3>
