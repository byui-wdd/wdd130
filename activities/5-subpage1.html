            <h3>Create the new HTML file</h3>
            <p>
              For this assignment, choose one of the pages you identified last
              week and made wireframes for that you will complete as your
              sub-page. A sub-page is a page with links back and forth to your
              main page. You only need to code one subpage in the Dry Oar site.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                Want a shortcut? We know that many of the elements from our home
                page should also be on your child pages...header, navigation,
                footer, colors, etc. So use the <kbd>index.html</kbd> as a
                starting point. Make a new file in your editor and save it with
                a meaningful name (for example if I were making a contact page I
                would name my new file <kbd>contact.html</kbd>)...then copy and
                paste the code from your index.html into your new file, update
                the <kbd>&lt;title&gt;</kbd>, and delete the content that is
                specific to the home page and Voila! you have a great start on
                your new page.
              </p>
              <h4>Note</h4>
              <p>
                You do not want to create a new .css file for this new page.
                This could create a problem of having pages look different in
                important ways because the styles in one file were updated and
                not the other. You should only have <strong>one</strong> .css
                file for your entire site. Add any new styles for this new html
                page to the bottom of your existing .css.
              </p>
            </div>
            <!--  END STEP  -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!--  BEGIN STEP  -->
            <h3>Add new content</h3>
            <p>
              Add the html necessary in your new page to contain the new
              content.
            </p>

            <p>
              Remember that the content I have provided can be found in Ilearn
              or here:
              <a target="_blank" href="../resources/subpage_content.html"
                >subpage content</a
              >.
            </p>

            <p>
              Pay attention to your wireframe and try to make the HTML represent
              your layout, ie. create boxes (sections or divs) to represent the
              rows and columns of your layout and to group related content
              together. Open your website into your browser to make sure the web
              page displays correctly. Pay special attention to whether your
              images are all displaying. Once verified, begin adding the CSS to
              your site .css file to finish the page.
            </p>

            <!-- <p>Once you finish the first sub-page, repeat the process for the second. Both pages are due with
                        the final on the last week. To make sure you don't run out of time get one of your sub-pages
                        done by the end of week 8.</p> -->
            <!--  END STEP  -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!--  BEGIN STEP  -->

            <!--  END STEP  -->

          <h2>Grading</h2>
          <!-- <p>
            This activity will be graded next week using the following rubric:
          </p> -->
          <ul>
            <li>
              Significant textual content consisting of appropriate content for
              your audience so that they can understand the meaning and message
              of the page. There must also be at least one image in addition to
              the logo. You must have working links to your main page and any
              child pages (to and from) you are creating for this website. Your
              header (logo/navigation bar) and your footer (copyright/name and
              social media icon links) from the main page. Your page must be
              visually appealing. (20 pts)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="callout">
          <h3>What is meant by &ldquo;visually appealing?&rdquo;</h3>
          <p>
            I wish there was a non-subjective way to measure this... but there
            isn't. Generally you only lose points for this with things that are
            obvious. For example, text that is difficult to read because it uses
            a color to similar to the background, a navigation bar that is
            directly against a banner or the text of the page rather than having
            some space around it, use of a color scheme that obviously indicates
            no thought was put into the color choices (this doesn't mean that
            you can't use white - it's more stating that if you just threw
            colors onto the page for the sake of throwing colors onto the page
            and it is obvious, you'll lose points), etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you simply copy/pasted the text from the content page in most
            cases it will <strong>not</strong> be visually appealing. Make sure
            that you format it to make it more readable! Be generous with
            &lt;p&gt; tags, padding, margins, and maybe even &lt;ul&gt;s. You
            <strong>will</strong> lose points on this if you do not put some
            thought into the readability of the text.
          </p>
          <h3>What is considered &ldquo;significant content?&rdquo;</h3>
          <p>
            Each page of a website should clearly convey to the user what the
            page is for. If it is a main/home page, it should provide the user
            with enough information to know what your site is about, whether it
            contains the information/products they are looking for, and,
            thereby, whether they should stick around and keep looking through
            your website. As another example, if you have a "Contact Us" page,
            you usually need more than just a contact form/email address. The
            page should have enough information that the user knows what the
            contact form/email address is for, what happens when they contact
            you, what type of information you want the user to provide when
            contacting you, etc.
