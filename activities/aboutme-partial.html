<h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
<p>Estimated Time: 60 minutes</p>
<p>This week we have two important goals. One to introduce you to HTML, and two to introduce you to each other. With this activity
    we will accomplish both.</p>
<ol class="bigSteps">
    <li>
        <!-- START STEP -->
        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>If you haven&rsquo;t already, make sure to complete the instructions in the&nbsp;

        <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
        <p>Let's learn the vocabulary you will need to succeed in this course.</p>
        <div class="callout">
            <p>HTML has some very specific vocabulary that comes with it. It is important that we become familiar with it. Spend
                a few minutes familiarizing yourself with the following list. You will have a hard time making sense of the
                instruction given in this course if you don't understand these terms.
            </p>
            <dl class="def-list">
                <dt>
                    <strong>Tag</strong>
                </dt>
                <dd>HTML tags are key words surrounded by angle brackets: ie&nbsp;
                    <pre><code class="html">&lt;body&gt;</code></pre>
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    <strong>Element</strong>
                </dt>
                <dd>An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and end tag, with the content inserted in between:
                    <pre><code class="html">&lt;p&gt;Content&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    <strong>Nesting</strong>
                </dt>
                <dd>Elements placed inside of other elements are called nested. Nested Elements are indented to make it easier
                    to see which elements are inside of others.
                    <pre><code class="html">&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    <strong>Parent</strong>
                </dt>
                <dd>In nesting the parent is the element that contains other elements.</dd>
                <dt>
                    <strong>Child</strong>
                </dt>
                <dd>In nesting a child element is contained&nbsp;
                    <em>inside</em>&nbsp;of another element
                    <pre><code class="html">&lt;div&gt;  &lt;-- Parent --&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;Content&lt;/p&gt; &lt;-- Child --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    <strong>Attribute</strong>
                </dt>
                <dd>Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are placed inside of the opening tag.
                    The value of the attribute should be wrapped in quotes. ie
                    <pre><code class="html">&lt;p title="A paragraph about where I am from" &gt;Idaho&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    <strong>Semantics</strong>
                </dt>
                <dd>Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language. Semantic elements = elements with
                    a meaning. Writing semantic HTML means using the html tag that best describes the content you are adding
                    to your page.</dd>

        <h2>Our first HTML</h2>
        <p>Let's write some HTML. Open (log into) Glitch, and create a new file called
            <code>aboutme.html</code>. (It needs to be exactly
            <code>aboutme.html</code>. No caps, no spaces.) Click on the
            <code>aboutme.html</code> file and type the HTML below.</p>
        <p>This code contains everything you need for a basic web page. It has most of the items listed above. Tags, elements,
            nesting, parent elements, child elements, and semantics. Can you spot them all?</p>
        <div class="callout">
            <h3>Note!</h3>
            <p>I encourage you to not take the shortcut of copy and paste here with the code examples. You will find that your
                ability to write HTML will improve dramatically if you type them all out.</p>
            <pre><code class="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;All About Me&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;
        &lt;nav&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;

        &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;!-- Your code goes here --&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

        <h2>Titles and Headlines</h2>
        <p>A visitor to a website should not have to guess what the page is about. The &lt;title&gt;&nbsp;says "All About Me".
            Although you can see "All About Me" looking at the html, it will not show up on the page.&nbsp; This is because
            &lt;title&gt; is in the &lt;head&gt; section and anything in the &lt;head&gt; is not seen in the browser window.&nbsp;
            &nbsp;Only items in the &lt;body&gt; section are actually seen on the page. The &lt;title&gt; shows up as the
            name of the tab or window.</p>
        <p>We can use a headline element on our page so that when someone visits your page, they will know what your page is
            about.</p>
        <div class="callout">
            <p>There are various sizes of headlines: &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt; These can be used to establish a hierarchy for
                your page. The
                <em>smaller</em> the number with the h like &lt;h1&gt; for instance, the
                <em>larger</em> the text and the more important the headline should be. An &lt;h1&gt; for example should be used
                for the
                <em>most important</em> title on the page. You should only use one &lt;h1&gt; on your page.</p>
            <p>&lt;h2&gt; tags would be the next level and you can use as many as you need. Think about the structure of this
                course. It is broken up into weeks and activities. An outline using headline elements would look like the
                following:</p>
            <div class="outline">
                <h1>WDD 100 (&lt;h1&gt;)</h1>
                <h2>Week1 (&lt;h2&gt;)</h2>
                <h3>Software Setup (&lt;h3&gt;)</h3>
                <h3>Getting to Know you (&lt;h3&gt;)</h3>
                <h3>Purpose and Audience (&lt;h3&gt;)</h3>
                <h2>Week2 (&lt;h2&gt;)</h2>
                <h3>Site Plan (&lt;h3&gt;)</h3>
                <h3>Getting Started (&lt;h3&gt;)</h3>
                <h2>Week3 (&lt;h2&gt;)</h2>
                ...
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>To let&nbsp;visitors to your page know what it is about at a glance, let's add a larger headline to advertise.&nbsp;Let's
            use the&nbsp;
            <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>&nbsp;tag for this. Add a line between the&nbsp;
            <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>&nbsp;elements and add an&nbsp;
            <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>opening tag,&nbsp;and type "About Me".&nbsp; Then enter&nbsp;
            <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>&nbsp;to close the element. Let's add a sub-heading or two as well.&nbsp; Let's use &lt;h2&gt; (smaller text)
            and put your first name and your nickname if you have one.&nbsp; Do this right after the &lt;h1&gt; About Me&lt;/h1&gt;:
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
            <p>Now your code should look like this:</p>
            <pre><code class="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;All About Me&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;
        &lt;nav&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="aboutme.html"&gt;About Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
        &lt;!-- Your code goes here --&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;About Me&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Your First Name Here&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Your Nick Name Here (optional)&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

        <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
        <p>Next, let's write a few paragraphs to tell little bit about yourself. Here is a list of ideas to talk about to get
            you started. Remember however that this will be a public website...so don't put anything too personal or identifying.</p>
        <div class="callout">
            <ul>
                <li>Your first name and perhaps a nick-name.</li>
                <li>What degree and/or career path are you headed down.</li>
                <li>What are some of the things you love to do, hobbies.</li>
                <li>Are you married, do you have children, grandchildren...&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Do you have a current career/job... are you making a change by pursuing your education.</li>
                <li>The thing you love most about BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; What degree are you pursuing?&nbsp; AA BS, WDD?</li>
                <li>The advantages you see from learning about careers in web design, why you are taking the course, what you
                    hope to get out of it, and how you will use the information in your personal or professional life.
                </li>
                <li>How long have you been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints?&nbsp; Do you have a favorite
                    quote from one of the leaders of the church?&nbsp; Do you have a favorite scripture?
                </li>
                <li>Anything else you may want to share.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Start with the &lt;p&gt; (paragraph) that says "Hello World".&nbsp; Replace that with your own information and wording.
            Each time you want a new paragraph (please break it into more than one paragraph!) Add a new
            <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> element.</p>

        <p>When you have finished adding your paragraphs you will want to view your webpage. To do this click on the "Show"
            button at the top left of the screen. "Show" always starts with the
            <strong>
                <code>index.html</code>
            </strong> page, but you can click on the link we created there to see the
            <strong>
                <code>aboutme.html</code>
            </strong> page instead. Once you are on that page you can hit Refresh on your browser to see additional changes
            as you make them. Your page and HTML might look something like the images below:</p>
        <div class="fig-block">
            <figure>
                <img alt="About me html" src="../images/about-me-step5-html.jpg" title="About me html" />
                <figcaption>HTML example</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img alt="About me page" src="../images/about-me-step5-page.jpg" title="About me page" />
                <figcaption>Resulting page</figcaption>

        <h2>Add an image</h2>
        <p>Look's good, but it is a little plain.&nbsp;Let's add an image to dress up your page.</p>

        <p>Before you can put an image on your web page, you have to get it onto a web server. Lucky for us Glitch makes this
            easy. We simply need to upload the image from your computer to your assets folder in Glitch. Click on the assets
            link and then drag and drop your image to the assets page.&nbsp; Then to put the image on your page, click on
            the image and then click on the"copy url" button.&nbsp; That puts the image link on your clipboard so that you
            can paste it into the image tag:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <div class="fig-block">
            <figure>
                <img alt="Glitch adding assets" src="../images/glitch-asset1.png" title="Glitch adding assets" />
                <figcaption>Assets Tab</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img alt="Glitch adding assets" src="../images/glitch-asset2.png" title="Glitch adding assets" />
                <figcaption>Adding an Asset</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img alt="Glitch adding assets" src="../images/about-me-useassets.jpg" title="Glitch adding assets" />
                <figcaption>Using an Asset</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>

        <p>Put your image right after the &lt;h1&gt; line. You will start with the
            <code>img</code> tag. Images require additional information in order to work however. We have to tell the browser where to find
            the image. We can use an "attribute" for this. (Remember
            <strong>attribute</strong> was one of the vocabulary above. If you have forgotten what it is go review). The attribute
            we need is
            <code>src=""</code>. Add this right after the word
            <code>img</code>. So it will look like this:</p>
        <pre><code class="html">&lt;img src=""&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>Paste the URL you copied for your image into the "" after the
            <code>src</code>. The final tag should look something like this:</p>
        <pre><code class="html">&lt;img alt="image of me" src="https://cdn.glitch.com/3de58351-6a1f-4d05-80fc-6813c05f9c98%2Ffemaleicon.png"&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <p>Notice that I snuck an extra attribute in on you:
            <strong>
                <code>alt</code>
            </strong>. The
            <code>alt</code> attribute should contain a short description of the image. It is shown if the browser can't find the image or
            it is read for visually impaired visitors to your site.
            <strong>All</strong> of your images should have an
            <code>alt</code> attribute. If a tag has multiple attributes, the order of the attributes does not matter.</p>



        <p style="text-align: left;">There, that looks great.... you coded a web page about yourself that is simple, informative, and has a touch of style.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Your final page should look something like the pages below but with your information and your actual image.
        </p>

        <div class="fig-block">
            <figure>
                <img alt="Final Page" src="../images/about-me-final.jpg" title="Final example" />
