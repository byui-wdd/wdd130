            <p>Estimated Time: 60 minutes</p>
            <p>This week we have two important goals. One to introduce you to HTML, and two to introduce you to each other.
                With this activity we will accomplish both.</p>

                    <p>Let's learn the vocabulary you will need to succeed in this course.</p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>HTML has some very specific vocabulary that comes with it. It is important that we become familiar
                            with it. Spend a few minutes familiarizing yourself with the following list. You will have a
                            hard time making sense of the instruction given in this course if you don't understand these
                            terms.

                            <dd>An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and end tag, with the content inserted in between:

                                it easier to see which elements are inside of others.

                            <dd>Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are placed inside of the
                                opening tag. The value of the attribute should be wrapped in quotes. ie
                                <pre><code class="lang-markup html">&lt;p title="A paragraph about where I am from" &gt;Idaho&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

                            </dt>
                            <dd>Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language. Semantic elements
                                = elements with a meaning. Writing semantic HTML means using the html tag that best describes
                                the content you are adding to your page.</dd>

                        <kbd>aboutme.html</kbd>. (It needs to be exactly
                        <kbd>aboutme.html</kbd>. No caps, no spaces.) Click on the
                        <kbd>aboutme.html</kbd> file to open it in the editor and remove all of the contents. Then type the HTML
                        below.

                    <h2>Titles and Headlines</h2>
                    <p>A visitor to a website should not have to guess what the page is about. The
                        <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> says "All About Me". Although you can see "All About Me" looking at the html, it will not show up
                        on the page.&nbsp; This is because
                        <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> is in the
                        <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section and anything in the
                        <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> is not seen in the browser window. Only items in the
                        <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section are actually seen on the page. The
                        <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> shows up as the name of the tab or window.</p>
                    <p>We can use a headline element on our page so that when someone visits your page, they will know what
                        your page is about.</p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>There are various sizes of headlines:
                            <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> -
                            <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> These can be used to establish a hierarchy for your page. The
                            <em>smaller</em> the number with the h like
                            <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for instance, the
                            <em>larger</em> the text and the more important the headline should be. An
                            <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for example should be used for the
                            <em>most important</em> title on the page. You should only use one
                            <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> on your page.</p>
                        <p>
                            <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tags would be the next level and you can use as many as you need. Think about the structure
                            of this course. It is broken up into weeks and activities. An outline using headline elements
                            would look like the following:</p>
                        <div class="outline">
                            <h1>WDD 100 (&lt;h1&gt;)</h1>

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>To let&nbsp;visitors to your page know what it is about at a glance, let's add a larger headline to advertise.&nbsp;Let's
                        use the&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>&nbsp;tag for this. Add a line between the&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>&nbsp;elements and add an&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>opening tag,&nbsp;and type "About Me".&nbsp; Then enter&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>&nbsp;to close the element. Let's add a sub-heading or two as well.&nbsp; Let's use &lt;h2&gt; (smaller
                        text) and put your first name and your nickname if you have one.&nbsp; Do this right after the
                        <code>&lt;h1&gt;
                        About Me&lt;/h1&gt;</code>:

                    <p>Next, let's write a few paragraphs to tell little bit about yourself. Here is a list of ideas to talk
                        about to get you started. Remember however that this will be a public website...so don't put anything
                        too personal or identifying.</p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your first name and perhaps a nick-name.</li>
                            <li>What degree and/or career path are you headed down.</li>
                            <li>What are some of the things you love to do, hobbies.</li>
                            <li>Are you married, do you have children, grandchildren...&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>Do you have a current career/job... are you making a change by pursuing your education.</li>
                            <li>The thing you love most about BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; What degree are you pursuing?&nbsp; AA BS, WDD?</li>
                            <li>The advantages you see from learning about careers in web design, why you are taking the course,
                                what you hope to get out of it, and how you will use the information in your personal or
                                professional life.
                            </li>
                            <li>How long have you been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints?&nbsp; Do
                                you have a favorite quote from one of the leaders of the church?&nbsp; Do you have a favorite
                                scripture?
                            </li>
                            <li>Anything else you may want to share.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Start with the &lt;p&gt; (paragraph) that says "Hello World".&nbsp; Replace that with your own information
                        and wording. Each time you want a new paragraph (please break it into more than one paragraph!) Add
                        a new
                        <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> element.</p>

                    <p>When you have finished adding your paragraphs you will want to view your webpage. To do this click on
                        the "Show" button at the top left of the screen. "Show" always starts with the
                        <strong>
                            <kbd>index.html</kbd>
                        </strong> page, but you can click on the link we created there to see the
                        <strong>
                            <kbd>aboutme.html</kbd>
                        </strong> page instead. Once you are on that page you can hit Refresh on your browser to see additional changes
                        as you make them. Your page and HTML might look something like the images below:</p>
                    <div class="fig-block">

                    <h2>Add an image</h2>
                    <p>Look's good, but it is a little plain.&nbsp;Let's add an image to dress up your page.</p>

                    <p>Before you can put an image on your web page, you have to get it onto a web server. Lucky for us Thimble
                        makes this easy. We simply need to upload the image from your computer to your project in Thimble.
                        To do this simply drag the image file onto the browser window where you have Thimble open. Many images
                        do not have reader friendly names. You can see in the image below I uploaded an image called
                        <kbd>IMG_5684.jpg</kbd> to my project. I'm going to rename it just like I did the HTML file we created
                        earlier to something a little easier to remember. If you click on the image name it will open in
                        the editor so you can see what it is.</p>
                    <p>It also include a couple of nice bits of info. At the top you will see some colors that Thimble extracted
                        from your image. Below the image you can see an HTML example of how you would use this image in your
                        page.
                    </p>
                    <div class="fig-block">
                        <figure>
                            <img alt="Thimble adding images" src="../images/thimble-rename-image.jpg" title="Thimble adding images" />
                            <figcaption>Rename an Image</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <figure>
                            <img alt="Thimble image details" src="../images/thimble-image-detail.jpg" title="Thimble image details" />
                            <figcaption>Image details</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                    </div>

                    <p>Put your image right after the &lt;h1&gt; line. You will start with the
                        <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. Images require additional information in order to work however. We have to tell the browser
                        where to find the image. We can use an "attribute" for this. (Remember
                        <strong>attribute</strong> was one of the vocabulary above. If you have forgotten what it is go review).
                        The attribute we need is
                        <kbd>src=""</kbd>. Add this right after the word
                        <kbd>img</kbd>. So it will look like this:</p>
                    <pre><code class="html">&lt;img src=""&gt;</code></pre>
                    <p>Enter the name of your image into the "" after the
                        <code>src</code>. The final tag should look something like this:</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-markup html">&lt;img src="r2d2.jpg" alt="Image of me?" /&gt;</code></pre>
                    <p>Notice that Thimble and I included an extra attribute:
                        <strong>
                            <kbd>alt</kbd>
                        </strong>. The
                        <kbd>alt</kbd> attribute should contain a short description of the image. It is shown if the browser can't
                        find the image or it is read for visually impaired visitors to your site.
                        <strong>All</strong> of your images should have an
                        <kbd>alt</kbd> attribute. If a tag has multiple attributes, the order of the attributes does not matter.</p>



                    <p style="text-align: left;">There, that looks great.... you coded a web page about yourself that is simple, informative, and has
                        a touch of style.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Your final page should look something like the pages below but with your information and your actual
                        image.
                    </p>
