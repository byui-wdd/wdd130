        <p>
          This activity is an opportunity to pull together many of the things
          you have learned this semester by writing the HTML and CSS to build a
          simple media card UI. Below is a mockup of what our component should
          look like when done. (A component is just a part of a web page that is
          commonly used more than once.)
        </p>

        <div class="fig-block">
          <figure>
            <img
              alt="Media Card example"
              src="../images/card-2.png"
              title="Media Card example"
            />
            <figcaption>Media Card example</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <ol class="bigSteps">
          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Set the foundation</h3>

            <p>
              Review the mockup above. It looks like there are three groupings
              of content. The image above, the paragraph, and the buttons and
              time on the bottom. We need to add the HTML elements to define
              those areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Create a new file in your editor and name it <kbd>card.html</kbd>.
              Remove anything that might be in the <code>body</code> element and
              add an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element and give it a
              <kbd>class</kbd> of <kbd>card</kbd>. This will be the basis of our
              media component.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next add an image. You can use
              <kbd>https://picsum.photos/320/240</kbd> for the <kbd>src</kbd>.
              It will pull a random image of the correct size for our component.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next add a paragraph. You can pull the contents of it from the
              mockup above.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally add a <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. It should have two
              buttons in it (give one a class of <kbd>viewButton</kbd> and the
              other a class of <kbd>editButton</kbd>), and a span which will
              hold the time.
            </p>
            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Base style.</h3>

            <p>
              For our CSS to keep it simple we will use a
              <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element in the
              <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. All of your CSS should go in that
              element. Begin by adding the following rule to the top of your css
              as well. It will make the image work correctly.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">img {
  max-width: 100%;
}</code></pre>

            <p>
              Next add a <code>.card</code> class. Make the width of our card
              <kbd>320px</kbd>
            </p>
            <p>
              You should also notice that the card has a white background, a
              slight shadow, and rounded corners. Rounded corners can be
              accomplished with the
              <a
                href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_border-radius.asp"
                target="_blank"
                >border-radius</a
              >
              property. It can take 1 or 4 values. If one then it will apply the
              same curve to all four corners. This is what we want here.
            </p>
            <p>
              The shadow under the card can be done with the
              <a
                href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.asp"
                target="_blank"
                >css3_pr_box-shadow</a
              >
              property. Check out the preceeding link for details...but for now
              I will give you some settings that will work for us.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">.card {
  width: 320px;
  box-shadow: 1px 1px 4px 1px #888;
  border-radius: 3px;
  background-color: white;       
}
     </code></pre>
            <p>That will get you started.</p>
            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Finishing up</h3>

            <p>
              For the rest of the styling the following details will be helpful:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Set your font to a nice <kbd>sans-serif</kbd> font. Arial or
                Helvetica should work.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you give <kbd>border-radius</kbd> 4 values, it starts with
                the top left corner and goes clockwise. So
                <kbd>3px 0 0 3px</kbd> would curve the top-left and bottom-left
                corner for example.
              </li>
              <li>
                For the grey colors <kbd>#888</kbd> is a nice medium grey, and
                <kbd>#ccc</kbd> is a nice light grey
              </li>
              <li>
                Remember that the space between two elements is controlled by
                <code>margin</code>. The space between the contents of an
                element and the border of the element is controlled by
                <code>padding</code>. You will need to add padding to many of
                the elements to get your component to look like the mockup.
              </li>
              <li>
                As you work on rounding the corners of the card, if you have
                issues with the top corners it is probably the corners of the
                image covering up the rounded corners of the box. You can use
                the
                <a
                  href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_overflow.asp"
                  target="_blank"
                  >overflow</a
                >
                property to fix this. Adding <code>overflow: hidden</code> to
                the card will make any content that falls outside of that
                element be hidden (like the square corners of your image).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>

            <p>Upload your link to ILearn.</p>
