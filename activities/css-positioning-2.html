          In this activity we will take another look at positioning and layout
          with CSS. We will get some more practice using CSS Grid and also look
          closely at alignment. Both with Grid and without.

                Vocabulary time! There are a few terms we should learn to help
                make sense of alignment with CSS Grid.
              </p>

              <dl>
                <dt><code>justify-content</code></dt>
                <dd>
                  Aligns the grid container along the inline axis (by default
                  horizontal). This only works when the grid is narrower than
                  the space available.
                </dd>
                <dt><code>justify-items</code></dt>
                <dd>
                  Aligns the grid item contents along the inline axis (by
                  default horizontal). This only works when the contents of a
                  grid cell are narrower than the grid cell.
                </dd>
                <dt><code>align-content</code></dt>
                <dd>
                  Aligns the grid container along the block axis (by default
                  vertical). This only works when the grid is shorter than the
                  space available.
                </dd>
                <dt><code>align-items</code></dt>
                <dd>
                  Aligns the grid item contents along the block axis (by default
                  vertical). This only works when the contents of a grid cell
                  are shorter than the grid cell.
                </dd>
              </dl>
              <p>
                So to review, <kbd>justify</kbd> aligns horizontal by default,
                <kbd>align</kbd> takes care of the other direction (vertical
                alignment by default). If we want to align the grid container we
                use the <kbd>content</kbd> suffix. If we want to align the
                contents of the grid items within the grid cells then we use
                <kbd>items</kbd>
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              Visit
              <a href="https://codepen.io/matkat/pen/eQENmb" target="_blank"
                >this codepen</a
              >
              (Codepen is a site that allows you to practice writing HTML and
              CSS). You should see three sets of four boxes. The boxes have
              already been positioned into a square using CSS Grid. There are
              some differences between them however. If you look at the
              <code>.content1</code> class you will see that the rows and
              columns have been sized using <kbd>1fr</kbd>. So the grid will use
              up all the space available in the grid container, and we will end
              up with 2 equal columns and 2 equal rows.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we look in the browser development tools at the actual grid we
              see this:
            </p>
            <div class="fig-block">
              <figure>
                <img
                  src="../images/layout2-content1.png"
                  alt="grid lines example"
                />
                <figcaption>Grid lines for content1</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <p>
              Let's try centering the grid and grid items. Add the folowing to
              <code>.content1</code>
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">justify-content: center;
align-content: center;
            </code></pre>
            <p>
              You might be surprised to see <strong>nothing</strong> happened
              until you remember that <kbd>content</kbd> refers to aligning the
              grid container. The grid container is completely filling the
              parent element it is in. If something is as big as it's parent
              then it is technically already centered...it <em>can't</em> move.
            </p>
            <p>Next add these lines one at a time:</p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">justify-items: center;
align-items: center;
                          </code></pre>
            <p>
              Now we see something happen! The boxes centered themselves inside
              of the grid cell they were in. First horizontally
              (<kbd>justify</kbd>), then vertically (<kbd>align</kbd>)
            </p>
            <p>
              The next example uses rows and columns of a fixed size.
              <kbd>150px</kbd> to be exact. This time the contents of the grid
              is the same size as the grid cell, but the grid itself is smaller
              than the space it has available. Here is a picture of the grid
              lines this time.
            </p>
            <div class="fig-block">
              <figure>
                <img
                  src="../images/layout2-content2.png"
                  alt="grid lines example 2"
                />
                <figcaption>Grid lines for Content2</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <p>
              This time if we attempt to align the items nothing happens. Try
              adding the following properties to <code>.content2</code>
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">justify-items: center;
align-items: center;
            </code></pre>
            <p>
              ...but now we can align the grid container. Add these one at a
              time:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">justify-content: center;
align-content: center;
     </code></pre>
            <p>
              Last example. For <code>.content3</code>. We have the grid
              container smaller than the parent, and the grid items smaller than
              the grid cell.
            </p>
            <div class="fig-block">
              <figure>
                <img
                  src="../images/layout2-content3.png"
                  alt="grid lines example 3"
                />
                <figcaption>Grid lines for Content3</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <p>
              Add the following four lines to the <code>.content3</code> rule
              one at a time and watch what happens.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">justify-content: center;
align-content: center;
justify-items: center;
align-items: center;
              </code></pre>
            <p>Perfectly centered content!</p>

            <h3>Other ways to align.</h3>
            <p>
              Earlier in the semester you were introduced to the concept of
              <kbd>block</kbd> and <kbd>inline</kbd> elements. Blocks flow
              vertically down the page by default, and inline flows horizontally
              across. You were also shown how to align both inline and block
              elements. Let's review that again now.
            </p>
            <p>
              Block elements first: block elements take up 100% of the width
              available to them. So if we want to align them we first have to
              set a width of less than 100% on them. Then we can set the left
              and/or right margin to <kbd>auto</kbd>. For center we would set
              <em>both</em> left and right to auto (<code>margin: 0 auto;</code
              >), for right aligned blocks we would set <em>just</em> the left
              margin to auto (<code>margin-left: auto;</code>). Blocks are left
              aligned by default so we don't have to do anything for that!.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use
              <a href="https://codepen.io/matkat/pen/EObyVY" target="_blank"

              to practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Take a look at the following screenshot to see what we are trying
              to do.
            </p>
            <div class="fig-block">
              <figure>
                <img
                  src="../images/layout2-poem.png"
                  alt="block/inline alignment"
                />
                <figcaption>Poem alignment example</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <p>The alignment of the poem can be described like this:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Block 1 should be left aligned</li>
              <li>Block 2 should be center aligned</li>
              <li>Block 3 should be right aligned</li>
              <li>Block 4 should be center aligned</li>
              <li>
                The first paragraph in blocks 1,2,3 should be left aligned.
              </li>
              <li>
                The second paragraph in blocks 1,2,3 should be center aligned.
              </li>
              <li>
                The third paragraph in blocks 1,2,3 should be right aligned.
              </li>
              <li>The first paragraph in block 4 should be right aligned.</li>
              <li>The second paragraph in block 4 should be center aligned.</li>
              <li>
                The third and fourth paragraphs in block 4 should be left
                aligned.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              All of our blocks are made of
              <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> elements. Remember that if we want to
              align a block element (sections are block elements) we need to set
              a width, then adjust the margins. Set a width of <kbd>50%</kbd> on
              all of the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then set the alignment of each <kbd>block</kbd> by adjusting the
              margins appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next we need to align the paragraphs. We could add a
              <kbd>class</kbd> to each paragraph and change them that way...but
              that is a lot of extra typing, and there is another way. We can
              take advantage of complex selectors. Specifially the
              <a
                href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_nth-of-type.asp"
                target="_blank"
                >:nth-of-type()</a
              >
              pseudo selector.
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>:nth-of-type()</code> counts the number of times a
              particular element is the child of another element. Here is an
              example with paragraphs:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">p:nth_of_type(1) { /* first paragraph */}
p:nth-of-type(2) { /* second paragraph */}
p:nth-of-type(3) { /* third paragraph */}
            </code></pre>
            <p>
              Using those selectors write the css that will format the text
              according to the requirements above. Note that block4 is formatted
              differently than the others. For those paragraphs we will need to
              be more specific. Target just paragraphs that are in the
              <code>.block4</code> element.
            </p>
