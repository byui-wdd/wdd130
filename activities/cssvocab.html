          Just like with HTML, CSS also has some important vocabulary that you
          should be familiar with as we move forward.

            <p>
              Let's learn the CSS vocabulary you will need to succeed in this
              course.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                CSS has some very specific vocabulary that comes with it. It is
                important that we become familiar with it. Spend a few minutes
                familiarizing yourself with the following list. You will have a
                hard time making sense of the instruction given in this course
                if you don't understand these terms.
              </p>

              <dl class="def-list">
                <dt><strong>Selector</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                  How you specify to the browser which HTML element(s) should be
                  changed. We will focus primarily on 3 kinds of selectors in
                  this class:
                  <ol>
                    <li>element</li>
                    <li>.class</li>
                    <li>#id</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>For example, if we have the following HTML:</p>
                  <pre><code class="lang-markup html">&lt;p&gt;No class or id on this paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="green"&gt;This paragraph has a class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="green" id="paragraph3"&gt;This paragraph has a class and an id &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    We could select all of the paragraphs by using the element
                    selector: <code>p</code> (Notice that there is no
                    preface...we simply use the tag name)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We could select just the second and third paragraphs by
                    using the class attribute on them as a selector like this:
                    <code>.green</code> (Notice that we preface the class name
                    with a period)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ...and we could select just the last paragraph by using its
                    ID as a selector like this: <code>#paragraph3</code> (Notice
                    that we preface the ID with a hashtag)
                  </p>
                  <pre><code class="lang-css">p /* element selector: all paragraphs */
.green /* class selector: all paragraphs with an attribute class="green" */
#paragraph3 /* id selector: the paragraph with the attribute id="paragraph3" */</code></pre>
                </dd>
                <dt><strong>Property</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                  What we want to change about the element(s) selected by our
                  selector. ie
                  <pre><code class="lang-css">background-color</code></pre>
                </dd>
                <dt><strong>Value</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                  How we want to change a property
                  <pre><code class="lang-css">green</code></pre>
                </dd>
                <dt><strong>Declaration</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                  A combination of a property and value with a colon.
                  Declarations must end with a semi-colon (;)
                  <pre><code class="lang-css">background-color: green;</code></pre>
                </dd>
                <dt><strong>Declaration Block</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                  One or more declarations will be combined into a block using
                  curly braces: {}
                  <pre><code class="lang-css">{
    background-color: green;
    margin: 5px;    
}</code></pre>
                </dd>
                <dt><strong>Rule (or Rule-set)</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                  A rule is the combination of a selector and declaration block.
                  The example below would select all elements with a
                  class="green" and turn their background green!
                  <pre><code class="lang-css">.green {
    background-color: green;
    margin: 5px;    
}</code></pre>
                </dd>
                <dt><strong>Units</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                  Many properties require a value with units. Some units are
                  absolute meaning that they are always the same size. Other
                  units are relative meaning that their size changes based on
                  something else (like the size of the text or the width or the
                  browser or an element). Common CSS units are: px (absolute),
                  em (relative, based off of font size), and % (relative, based
                  off of width)
                </dd>
              </dl>

                Just like with the HTML, I do not expect you to memorize all of
                the properties, etc in these links at this point. The goal is to
                familiarize yourself with the concepts and learn to recognize
                instances of the terms above. The site that these link to is
                also a great resource for learning/reviewing HTML and CSS
                concepts in general.

              find. After looking on your own, select each term from our list
              one at a time on the right and see if you found all the instances.
              This list has more vocabulary on it than I asked you to learn.
              Don't let this overwhelm or distract you. Focus on the list above.
