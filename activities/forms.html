            <h1>Working with HTML Forms</h1>
            <hr />

            <p>Forms in HTML are a very important topic. They provide the primary means to get input back from the
                users of our sites. Functional forms would have two parts. The actual HTML form styled with CSS, and
                then some code running on a server that the form data would get sent to. The Server part is very
                important to building a <em>working</em> form, but is beyond the scope of this course. We will be
                focussing on the HTML and CSS part of building forms. Our form will not do much when submitted, and
                that's ok.</p>

                    <h3>MDN Forms article</h3>
                    <p>The Mozilla Developer Network (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/About"
                            target="_blank">MDN</a>) is a great resource for learning more about working with the Web.
                        To begin learning about forms complete this tutorial <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Your_first_HTML_form"
                            target="_blank">Your First Form</a> on MDN.</p>
                    <p>Create a file in your Thimble project called <kbd>forms.html</kbd> where you will complete the
                        activity above.</p>

                    <h3>Functional Forms</h3>
                    <p>Our form currently doesn't do anything (or maybe even gives you an error) if you submit it. If
                        you would like it to do <em>something</em> we need to add a bit of code to your project.</p>
                    <p>Before your form let's add an element to hold a success message when the form has been
                        submitted.
                        Add a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element with an <kbd>id="feedback"</kbd> <strong>above</strong>
                        your form element.</p>
                    <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;div id="feedback"&gt;&lt/div&gt;
</code></pre>
                    <p>The exercise had you create a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element to hold the styling it wanted
                        for the form. Add the following CSS to that below the other styles.</p>
                    <pre><code class="lang-css">#feedback {
    background-color: antiquewhite;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    padding: .5em;
    /* make this element invisible until we are ready for it */
    display: none;
        
}
.moveDown {
    margin-top: 3em;
}
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>Finally <strong>below</strong> your form element add the following code:</p>
                    <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;script&gt;
    // get the feedback div element so we can do something with it.
    const feedbackElement = document.getElementById('feedback');
    // get the form so we can read what was entered in it.
    const formElement = document.forms[0];
    // add a 'listener' to wait for a submission of our form. When that happens run the code below.
    formElement.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
        // stop the form from doing the default action
        e.preventDefault();
        // set the contents of our feedback element to a message letting the user know the form was submitted successfully. Notice that we pull the name that was entered in the form to personalize the message!
        feedbackElement.innerHTML = 'Hello '+ formElement.user_name.value +'! Thank you for your message. We will get back with you as soon as possible!';
        // make the feedback element visible.
        feedbackElement.style.display = "block";
        // add a class to move everything down so our message doesn't cover it.
        document.body.classList.toggle('moveDown');
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>If everything is working correctly you should see a message appear at the top of the form upon
                        submission.</p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>The code above is something we have not seen before. It is Javascript. I added lots of
                            comments
                            if you want to try and understand what is going on. Javascript can be used to make our page
                            more interactive, to change based on user actions, but is quite different from HTML and
                            CSS. Don't worry if it doesn't make
                            sense. The purpose of this class is not to teach Javascript, but I wanted to give you a
                            small
                            introduction...and forms are more fun if they <em>do</em> something!</p>

                    <p>We have just scratched the surface with forms. The next two steps in the MDN tutorial are also
                        great and will teach you much more about the details of working with forms. It is not require
                        to complete them, but it would be worth your time if you do!</p>
