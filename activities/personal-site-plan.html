            <h1>Your personal Site Plan</h1>
            <hr />

            <p>Just as we did for the Dry Oar site, before we build our personal (final) project we need to do some
                planning. We started this last week by preparing our purpose. This week we will begin a Site plan for
                the
                personal site we want to build that is very similar to the one we prepared for Dry Oar.</p>
            <p>Let's start by creating a new project in Thimble to use for our final website. I have a template site
                you can remix with a blank HTML based site plan. <a href="https://thimbleprojects.org/matkat/552850"
                    target="_blank">Remix</a> this site to get
                started.</p>
            <p>As you look at the new site plan template you will notice it is very similar to the last one. It does
                have a new section however...Content. For the Dry Oar site I provided you with content, you will need
                to generate all of the content (text and media) for your site.</p>
            <p>You will also be required to create three wireframes. One for each page in your site.</p>
            <p>We will have some activities designed to help you complete your site plan...but much of it you will need
                to do on your own. The completed site plan for your personal site is due at the end of <strong>Week 9</strong>.
                This gives you three weeks to complete it. <strong>Don't wait until the beginning of Week 9 to start!</strong>!</p>
