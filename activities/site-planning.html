            <h3>What is a Site Plan?</h3>
            <p>Developing a a site plan is a critical step in any web design process. Site plans help establish the purpose
                of the site, the voice, and overall look and feel...and then they help you apply those consistently across
                your site.</p>
            <p>Site plans come in many shapes and sizes, and level of detail. Here is a list of common elements in a site plan</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Statement of purpose and goals</li>
                <li>Definition of audience</li>
                <li>personas and scenarios - Who will use the site and how will they use it?</li>
                <li>A Style guide:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Branding information - how to use the branding for the site correctly</li>
                        <li>Typography choices and justification</li>
                        <li>Color palette</li>
                        <li>Specific styling of elements on the site...ie headings, lists, paragraphs, forms, links, buttons,
                            etc
                        </li>
                        <li>A site map</li>
                        <li>Wireframes showing general layout and content for major pages</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will be making a simplified site plan for our web site. Ours will focus on the sections for Purpose, audience
                and a partial style guide. Since the style guide will be the largest portion lets take a look at a few examples
                to get a better idea about how they are put together.</p>
            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <h4>FamilySearch</h4>
            <div class="fig-block">
                <figure>
                    <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/" target="_blank">
                        <img alt="Family Search Home" height="239" src="../images/familysearch.jpg" title="familysearch Home" width="388" />
                    </a>
                    <figcaption>
                        <a href="http://familysearch.com/" target="_blank">FamilySearch Home</a>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <a href="https://familysearch.org/reference/styleguide/" target="_blank">
                        <img alt="FamilySearch Style Guide" height="239" src="../images/familysearch-style.jpg" title="familysearch Style Guide"
                            width="369" />
                    </a>
                    <figcaption>
                        <a href="https://familysearch.org/reference/styleguide/" target="_blank">FamilySearch Style Guide</a>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>FamilySearch has a nice styleguide viewable by anyone. Notice how many colors they use! As you browse around
                the actual site do you think it's too many or does it work? Notice that they also have a section about font
                sizes and paragraph and headline styling, but it never really mentions which fonts they use.</p>
            <p>Take a moment and think about the purpose and audience of the site. Does the site accomplish the purpose well
                and cater to its audience? What do you like/dislike about this site? Share your thoughts with the class.</p>
            <h4>A List Apart</h4>
            <div class="fig-block">
                <figure>
                    <a href="http://alistapart.com/" target="_blank">

            <p>A List Apart is a website by web designers for web designers. Much of it's content comes from guest authors so
                having a well defined style guide is essential to keep everything consistent. The different fonts and colors
                are clearly defined, then it defines the styling for the many different elements you might find in an article...it
                even includes example html!</p>
            <p>Take a moment and think about the purpose and audience of the site. Does the site accomplish the purpose well
                and cater to it's audience? What do you like/dislike about this site? Share your thoughts with the class.</p>


            <h2>Activity Directions</h2>
            <p>All of those examples were much bigger and more complex than what we will do for our site. However even though
                our site will be a simple 3 page website for a White Water Rafting Company, this planning phase is still
                important and you are expected to produce a site plan that is complete and professional looking.</p>

                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3> Template</h3>

                    <p>Begin by downloading the template for the siteplan. The template contains an outline and additional instructions.
                        The instructions are in red and are intended to be removed
                        <em>after</em> you have followed them. Make sure to read
                        <strong>and</strong> follow them. When you are finished with your site plan, there should be no red directions
                        on the pages (except for the wireframe directions on the last page).</p>

                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Purpose Statement</h3>

                    <p>From the beginning, websites have always been about displaying content. This is the underlying purpose
                        behind every site on the internet, or at least it should be. In order to determine which content
                        you should put on the site it is critical to determine the purpose or goals of the site. The content
                        should support that purpose. At a high level these purposes can take many forms:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Build Revenue&nbsp;</strong>Build revenues for your new/existing business or</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Share Information&nbsp;</strong>Share corporate or educational information or</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Share Opinions&nbsp;</strong>Share opinions on a subject or</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Share Personal Interests&nbsp;</strong>Share personal interests with family and friends</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All websites should have a purpose, and that purpose should be more than 'My teacher is making me do
                        this.' :) Earlier (see above) you should have spent some time analyzing a few websites to try and
                        determine what their purpose is, and who their audience is.</p>

                    <p>We need to do this now for our website. One problem: the purpose really needs to be defined by the site
                        owner and not the site builder. So for this step and the next imagine that you are the owner of the
                        business and have decided that it is time for you to have an online presence.&nbsp;
                        <strong>Develop a purpose statement that clearly defines your goals for the website</strong>. (at least 100
                        words)
                    </p>
                    <!-- END STEP -->
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Audience Statement</h3>

                    <p>Another important factor to keep in mind when planning a website, is the audience for the site. Remember,
                        that websites are all about content. The purpose helps define what content you should include, and
                        the content should target your specific audience or audiences (websites can have more than one).</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Write a statement specifically identifying your target audience</strong>. Try to answer these questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Who are the target customers? Describe their life (or business) situation (age, financial situation,
                            interests, etc)
                        </li>
                        <li>What do they want?</li>
                        <li>What are their needs that aren't being met?</li>
                        <li>How will my audience usually access my site (desktop, laptop, mobile device)? (at least 100 words)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <!-- END STEP -->
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Choose a logo</h3>
                    <p>Choosing a logo.&nbsp; One Dry Oar logo is in the document.&nbsp; You can keep that one for now, create
                        a logo of your own, or you can look through the links below and find a different logo for your site
                        from among the choices in the dry oar images link:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                        imagined above...
                        <strong>then lock it</strong>. Hit the space bar on your keyboard to generate different complementary color
                        schemes for the color you chose. Feel free to lock other colors and generate until you end up with
                        3-4 colors you like.

                    <p>Once you have built your palette note that at the bottom of each color column there is a 6 digit "number".
                        This is what is known as a hexadecimal color code and is usually preceded by a "#". These codes are
                        the most common way to represent colors on the web. Copy that code for the 3-4 colors you would like
                        to use into the Site plan document. Place the color you want to use the most often as the primary.</p>

                        Click on the PNG box to save a picture of your colors to your desktop. This will make an image that
                        you can drag into your Site Plan on the Color page to replace the placeholder image. You will also
                        want to save your chosen palette URL from coolers.co in case you need to make any changes later.</p>

                    <p>It's time now to choose a font or fonts that you will use for your site. Along with the colors you choose,
                        fonts have the next largest (or maybe even larger in some cases) impact on the look and feel of your
                        site.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Make sure the main font you use (the one that most of the text is in) is very readable.</li>
                            <li>It is OK, and often desirable to have more than 1 font on a page, but if you use more than 2
                                make sure you have a good reason for it.</li>
                            <li>If you use 2 fonts make sure there is good contrast between them...ie make sure they are different
                                enough that they will never be mistaken for the same font. A common pattern is to have a
                                very readable font from one font-family (serif, san-serif, script, monospace, fantasy) for
                                all the body copy (paragraphs), and a font from another family for the titles and headlines.</li>
                            <li>While you should usually sacrifice creativeness for readability for paragraphs, you can usually
                                get away with something more fun for headlines. They are usually larger in size and only
                                a few words in length, so feel free to experiment a bit more here.</li>
                            <li>For a page that loads very quickly you should stick with web-safe fonts. These are fonts that
                                can be found on every computer. (Not all fonts are on every computer.) A list can be found
                                on
                                <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts" target="_blank">Google has a large list of Fonts</a> that can be used on websites as well. Using them will
                                add a small amount of time to the speed at which the page loads...but often it is worth it
                                to get the right font.

                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Choose your fonts</h3>
                    <p>Choose one or two fonts to use for the site and record them along with your
                        <i>reasoning for choosing</i> them in the Site Plan. Then try applying the colors you chose above to
                        your fonts. See if there are two colors in your scheme that can be used as text color/background
                        color where the text remains readable (you need a high contrast between the colors). Black and White
                        are always fair game even if they aren't in your color scheme :)</p>
                    <!-- END STEP -->
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Style your navigation</h3>
                    <p>Finally from your
                        <em>color palette</em> choose the colors you would like to use for your navigational links (normal, hover,
                        active, and visited) and enter those colors. You should also describe your navigation styles with
                        an image or text. If you would like specific styling for other links on the pages you can provide
                        those on the Links section under HTML elements. </p>
                    <p>Think of the two child pages you will be creating (these may change as time goes on) and put the names
                        in each of the two empty boxes in the nav bar image. (In the directions, there are several page suggestions
                        listed. You can choose two of those or come up with your own, but the names should be one or two
                        words max.</p>
                    <p>The next section is the site map. It also has 3 boxes: home and two empty boxes. Put the same two child
                        page names you chose for the nav bar boxes.... these MUST be the same names for both parts.</p>
                    <p>The last page has a wireframe. The wireframe shows what the page will look like, how it will be laid
                        out. We will not be changing the wireframe yet, just review it. In the following weeks you will use
                        the wireframe provided to help you to create the home page for the site. Even later in the semester
                        you will create wireframes for the two pages you selected above, and build them as well.</p>

                    <li>Make sure that you have your title page with the Title of the Site Plan, your name and WDD100-Section
                        number.

                        for your site from coolors.co</li>
                    <li>Choose the Fonts you initially plan to use and then complete the nav bar (add the 2 other pages you plan
                        to use), and the site map (the same names that you used in the nav bar should also fill out the site
                        map boxes.&nbsp; Make sure you do not remove the nav bar image and the site map image.</li>
                    <li>Once finished, remove all directions from the site plan (all of the red text), except for the directions
                        for the wireframes. We will do that section later. Last, neaten the Site Plan before you submit it.&nbsp;
                        Put each section on its own page and make sure that it is all the way to the top of the page.&nbsp;
                        Also, remove any blank pages in the Plan and after the plan.</li>
