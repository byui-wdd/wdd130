        <h3>What is a Site Plan?</h3>
        <h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Task: Create a site plan to lay the groundwork for the site development</li>
            <li>Purpose: Prepare your website with the proper foundational information and guides.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
        <p>
          Developing a site plan is a critical step in any web design process.
          Site plans help establish the purpose of the site, the voice, and
          overall look and feel...and then they help you apply those
          consistently across your site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Site plans come in many shapes and sizes, and level of detail. Here is
          a list of common elements in a site plan
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Statement of purpose and goals</li>
          <li>Definition of audience</li>
          <li>
            Personas and scenarios - Who will use the site and how will they use
            it?
          </li>
          <li>
            A Style guide:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Branding information - how to use the branding for the site
                correctly
              </li>
              <li>Typography choices and justification</li>
              <li>Color palette</li>
              <li>
                Specific styling of elements on the site...ie headings, lists,
                paragraphs, forms, links, buttons, etc
              </li>
              <li>A site map</li>
              <li>
                Wireframes showing general layout and content for major pages
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We will be making a simplified site plan for our web site. Ours will
          focus on the sections for Purpose, audience and a partial style guide.
          Since the style guide will be the largest portion lets take a look at
          an examples to get a better idea about how site plan might be put together.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>

        </div>
        <p>
          FamilySearch has a nice styleguide viewable by anyone.
          Take a moment and think about the purpose and audience of the site.
          Does the site accomplish the purpose well and cater to its audience?
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is much bigger and more complex than what we
          will do for our site. However even though our site will be a simple website for a White Water Rafting Company, this planning phase is
          still important and you are expected to produce a site plan that is
          complete and professional looking.

            <h3>Prepare a place for our site plan</h3>
            <p>As we set up GitHub Pages we created a 'wwr' repository with an index.html file. This will eventually be the home page to our rafting site. We need to place our site plan html and css files in that same repository since it goes with that project.</p>
            <p>Open Visual Studio Code and make sure your project folder is added if it is not already there. You should see the project in the Explorer panel.</p>

            <h3>Purpose Statement</h3>

            <p>
              From the beginning, websites have always been about displaying
              content. This is the underlying purpose behind every site on the
              internet, or at least it should be. In order to determine which
              content you should put on the site it is critical to determine the
              purpose or goals of the site. The content should support that
              purpose. At a high level these purposes can take many forms:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Build Revenue&nbsp;</strong>Build revenues for your
                new/existing business or
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Share Information&nbsp;</strong>Share corporate or
                educational information or
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Share Opinions&nbsp;</strong>Share opinions on a subject
                or
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Share Personal Interests&nbsp;</strong>Share personal
                interests with family and friends
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              All websites should have a purpose, and that purpose should be
              more than 'My teacher is making me do this.' :) 
            </p>

            <p>
              We need to do this now for our website. One problem: the purpose
              really needs to be defined by the site owner and not the site
              builder. So for this step and the next, imagine that you are the
              owner of the business and have decided that it is time for you to
              have an online presence.&nbsp;
              <strong
                >Develop a purpose statement that clearly defines your goals for
                the website</strong
              >. Find the portion of the <kbd>site-plan-rafting.html</kbd> file for the
              purpose. It looks like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;h3&gt;Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Your purpose here]&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;!-- change this --&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              Replace <kbd>[Your purpose here]</kbd> with your purpose
              statement. 
            </p>
            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>Audience Statement</h3>

            <p>
              Another important factor to keep in mind when planning a website,
              is the audience for the site. Remember, that websites are all
              about content. The purpose helps define what content you should
              include, and the content should target your specific audience or
              audiences (websites can have more than one).

                Color plays an essential role in any website and so the colors

              and keeping your site purpose and audience in mind build a color
              scheme using it. Start by thinking of a color you like or think
              will work well for your site.
            </p>
            <p>
              Explore the color palettes. You will see 5 color stripes. Each color has 4 items on that show
              when you hover over them: Alternative Shades, drag, adjust, and
              lock. Play around with one color until you end up with something
              like you imagined above... <strong>then lock it</strong>. Hit the
              space bar on your keyboard to generate different complementary
              color schemes for the color you chose. Feel free to lock other
              colors and generate until you end up with 3-4 colors you like.

              Once you have built your palette note that at the bottom of each
              color column there is a 6 digit "number". This is what is known as
              a hexadecimal color code and is usually preceded by a "#". These
              codes are the most common way to represent colors on the web. Copy
              that code for the 3-4 colors you would like to use into the Site
              plan document. Place the color you want to use
              the most often as the primary.
            </p>
            <p>
              After entering the codes into the HTML file switch to the
              <kbd>site-plan.css</kbd> file. Notice that
              there is a place to record your colors there as well. Do so, then
              look at the Preview. You should see your colors showing in
              different areas!

              You should save your chosen palette URL from coolers.co in case
              you need to make any changes later. Copy the URL of your palette.
              (it might look something like this:
              https://coolors.co/b7d3f2-afafdc-8a84e2-84afe6-79beee) and paste
              it into your <kbd>site-plan.html</kbd>

            <pre><code class="lang-markup">Palette URL: &lt;a href="https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c" target="_blank"&gt;https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

              Notice that when working with links in HTML the destination of the
              link goes in the <kbd>src</kbd> attribute. Then the part you click
              on goes inside of the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element. Often those
              will be different...but in this case we are going to make them
              both the URL to your color scheme.

            <h3>About Fonts</h3>

            <p>
              Along with the colors you choose, fonts have the next
              largest (or maybe even larger in some cases) impact on the look
              and feel of your site. To help you think about this watch the
              following video.

            <h3>Choose your fonts</h3>
            <p>
              Choose one or two fonts to use for the site and record them in the Site Plan.
              Then we need to enter your fonts into the CSS file as well so we
              can really see what they will look like.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your fonts are from Google then look at @import in
              <kbd>site-plan-rafting.css</kbd>. This line lets our page know where to
              find the fonts we need. Change the example font names there to
              your fonts. Notice that if your font name has any spaces in it you
              should replace them with '+'. Look at my example:
            </p>
            <p>
              I want to use the following two fonts from Google:
              <kbd>IM Fell French Canon SC</kbd> and <kbd>Lato</kbd>
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=IM+Fell+French+Canon+SC|Lato');
                        </code></pre>
            <p>
              Notice in the <code>@import</code> my first font got changed to:
              <kbd>IM+Fell+French+Canon+SC</kbd> (spaces replaced with +). My
              second font was a simple one word font to it was added just as it
              was with a <kbd>|</kbd> (shift + \) separating my fonts.

            <h3>Color your fonts</h3>
            <p>
              Often you want your text to appear on a colored background. Let's
              pick some colors from your palette that will work well together.
            </p>
            <p>
              See if there are two colors in your scheme that can be used as
              text color/background color where the text remains readable (you
              need a high contrast between the colors). Black and White are
              always fair game even if they aren't in your color scheme :) You can always visit <a href='https://contrast-ratio.com' target="_blank">contrast-ratio.com</a> to make sure your text and the background of the text have a passing ratio.
            </p>
            </p>
            <p>
              Switch to the <kbd>site-plan-rafting.css</kbd> file find the lines that look like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">--headline-color-on-white: black;  /* headlines on a white background */ 
--headline-color-on-color: #FFFFFF; /* headlines on a colored background */ 
--paragraph-color-on-white: black; /* paragraph text on a white background */ 
--paragraph-color-on-color: #FFFFFF; /* paragraph text on a colored background */ 
--paragraph-background-color: #000000;</code></pre>
            <p>
              Change the <code>--paragraph-background-color</code> and then
              <code>--headline-color-on-color</code> and
              <code>--paragraph-color-on-color</code> values. If done correctly
              you should see an example of your colors together in the Preview
              of your page on Live Server. If any of the text is hard to read then
              try different colors.
            </p>

            <h3>Style your navigation</h3>
            <p>
              Finally from your <em>color palette</em> choose the colors you
              would like to use for your navigational links (normal, hover,
              and backgrounds) and enter those colors in the
              <kbd>site-plan-rafting.css</kbd> file. Hover over the menu option to make sure the hover colors look good too.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the Navigation section under Site Map you'll notice that there is a page called [Page2] this will eventually be replaced with a more meaningful page name. Since we haven't decided on this page yet, you can leave that as it is for now. But later we will be adding a child page to our rafting site and we can come back and change it then.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last section has a wireframe. The wireframe shows what the home page
              will look like, how it will be laid out. We will not be changing
              anything in this area, just review it. In the following weeks you will
              use the wireframe provided to help you to create the home page for
              the site. Later in the semester you will create a wireframe
              for the child page.
