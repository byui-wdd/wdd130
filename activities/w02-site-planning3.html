      <h3>What is a Site Plan?</h3>
      <h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Task:</b> Create a site plan to lay the groundwork for the site development.</li>
        <li><b>Purpose:</b> Prepare your website with the proper foundational information and guides.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
      <p>
        Developing a site plan is a critical step in any web design process.
        Site plans help establish the purpose of the site, the voice, and
        overall look and feel, and then they help you apply those
        consistently across your site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Site plans come in many shapes and sizes and in varying levels of detail. Here is
        a list of common elements in a site plan:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Statement of purpose and goals</li>
        <li>Definition of audience</li>
        <li>
          Personas and scenarios (Who will use the site and how will they use
          it?)
        </li>
        <li>
          A style guide:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Branding information (how to use the branding for the site
              correctly)
            </li>
            <li>Typography choices and justification</li>
            <li>Color palette</li>
            <li>
              Specific styling of elements on the site (headings, lists,
              paragraphs, forms, links, buttons, and so on)
            </li>
            <li>A site map</li>
            <li>
              Wireframes showing general layout and content for major pages
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We will be making a simplified site plan for our web site. Ours will
        focus on the sections for purpose, audience and a partial style guide.
        Since the style guide will be the largest portion, let's take a look at
        an example to get a better idea about how site plan might be put together.
      </p>
      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>This may not be a site plan, but this style guide demonstrates similar purposes of our siteplan we will create.</p>
      <h4>FamilySearch</h4>

        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>
        FamilySearch has a nice style guide that is viewable by anyone.
        Take a moment and think about the purpose and audience of the site.
        Does the site accomplish the purpose well and cater to its audience?
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is much bigger and more complex than what we
        will do for our site. However, even though our site will be a simple website for a White Water Rafting Company,
        this planning phase is
        still important, and you are expected to produce a site plan that is
        complete and professional-looking.

          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Prepare a place for our site plan</h3>
          <p>As we set up GitHub Pages, we created a 'wdd130' repository with an index.html file. Now we will create a folder within the wdd130 folder to hold our White Water Rafting project. The folder will be called 'wwr'. It will contain our site plan that we will work on this week and eventually all other files that make up our White Water Rafting site.</p>
          <p>Open Visual Studio Code and make sure your project folder 'wdd130' is added if it is not already there. You should
            see the project in the Explorer panel.</p>
          <p>Click on the 'New Folder' icon</p>

          <h3>Make Additions and/or Changes to the Template</h3>
          <p>Open the site-plan-rafting.html file in your VSCode editor. In the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> section of
            the code, add your site name, your name, and section number. (Notice that anywhere there are [ ] square

            'Purpose' <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> element, where it says '[Your purpose here]', and the audience paragraph,
            where it says '[Your audience here]'. The next steps explain what to type there.</p>

          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Purpose Statement</h3>

          <p>
            From the beginning, websites have always been about displaying
            content. This is the underlying purpose behind every site on the
            Internet, or at least it should be. In order to determine which
            content you should put on the site, it is critical to determine the
            purpose or goals of the site. The content should support that
            purpose. At a high level these purposes can take many forms:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Build Revenue&nbsp;</strong>: Build revenues for your
              new/existing business or
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Share Information&nbsp;</strong>: Share corporate or
              educational information or
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Share Opinions&nbsp;</strong>: Share opinions on a subject
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Share Personal Interests&nbsp;</strong>: Share personal
              interests with family and friends
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All websites should have a purpose, and that purpose should be
            more than 'My teacher is making me do this.'
          </p>

          <p>
            We need to do this now for our website. One problem: the purpose
            really needs to be defined by the site owner and not the site
            builder. So for this step and the next, imagine that you are the
            owner of the business and have decided that it is time for you to
            have an online presence.&nbsp;
            <strong>Develop a purpose statement that clearly defines your goals for
              the website</strong>. Find the portion of the <kbd>site-plan-rafting.html</kbd> file for the
            purpose. It looks like this:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;h3&gt;Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Your purpose here]&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;!-- change this --&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>
            Replace <kbd>[Your purpose here]</kbd> with your purpose
            statement.
          </p>
          <!-- END STEP -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Audience Statement</h3>

          <p>
            Another important factor to keep in mind when planning a website,
            is the audience for the site. Remember, that websites are all
            about content. The purpose helps define what content you should
            include, and the content should target your specific audience or
            audiences (websites can have more than one).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Write a statement specifically identifying your target
              audience</strong>. Try to answer these questions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Who are the target customers? Describe their life (or business)
              situation (age, financial situation, interests, and so on)
            </li>
            <li>What do they want?</li>
            <li>What are their needs that aren't being met?</li>
            <li>
              How will my audience usually access my site (desktop, laptop,
              mobile device)?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Add your Audience to your site plan just like you did for the
            Purpose above.
          </p>
          <!-- END STEP -->
        </li>
        <li class="fm">
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Choose a logo</h3>
          <p>
            You can keep the logo that is already in the site plan, or you can find or create a logo of your own. If you
            find an different logo or rafting company name, you are welcome to change the name from 'Dry Oar' to
            whatever name you'd like to have.
          </p>
          <p>The current logo is linked directly to an image that is already on the Web.</p>
          <div class="fig-block">
            <figure>
              <img class="wide" alt="Current logo location on web"

                title="Current logo location on web" />
              <figcaption>Current logo location on web</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>If you want to replace the logo with another one, place the image file into the image folder. You can even
            drag it into the folder. Then change the path value of the src to reference your new logo.</p>
          <div class="fig-block">
            <figure>
              <img class="wide" alt="Changed logo location to local images folder"
                src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w02/logo_src_changed.png"
                title="Changed logo location to local images folder" />
              <figcaption>Changed logo location to local images folder</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>The path is now pointing to the images folder and then the name of the image file inside the folder. Yours
            might have a different name than 'dryoarlogo.png'. Use the image file name you have in the images folder.

          <h3>Color Palette</h3>

          <p>
            Color plays an essential role in any website and so the colors
            you use should be chosen deliberately. The follow video is on color theory and can help with these choices.

            Visit
            <a href="https://coolors.co/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coolors.co</a>
            and, keeping your site purpose and audience in mind, build a color
            scheme using it. Start by thinking of a color you like or think
            will work well for your site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Explore the color palettes. You will see five color stripes. Each color has four items on that show
            when you hover over them: Alternative Shades, Drag, Adjust, and
            Lock. Play around with one color until you end up with something
            like you imagined above, <strong>then lock it</strong>. Hit the
            space bar on your keyboard to generate different complementary
            color schemes for the color you chose. Feel free to lock other
            colors and generate until you end up with 3&ndash;4 colors you like.

          <h3>About Fonts</h3>

          <p>
            Along with the colors you choose, fonts have the next
            largest (or maybe even larger in some cases) impact on the look
            and feel of your site. To help you think about this, watch the
            following video:

          <h3>Choose your fonts</h3>
          <p>
            Choose one or two fonts to use for the site and record them in the site plan.
            Then you need to enter your fonts into the CSS file as well so you
            can really see what they will look like.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your fonts are from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google,</a> then you will need the
            @import similar to what is at the top of the css file, <kbd>site-plan-rafting.css</kbd>. This line lets our
            page know where to
            find the fonts needed. Change the example font names there to
            your fonts. Or just replace the @import statement that is there, with the @import statement you got from
            Google Fonts. Notice that if your font name has any spaces in it you
            should replace them with '+'. Look at my example:
          </p>
          <p>
            The @import that is already in the site plan has two fonts from Google:
            <kbd>IM Fell French Canon SC</kbd> and <kbd>Lato</kbd>
          </p>
          <pre><code class="lang-css">
            @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=IM+Fell+French+Canon&family=Lato:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400&display=swap');;
                        </code></pre>
          <p>
            Notice in the <code>@import</code> my first font got changed to:
            <kbd>IM+Fell+French+Canon+SC</kbd> (spaces replaced with +). My
            second font was a simple one word font to it was added just as it
            was with a <kbd>|</kbd> (shift + \) separating my fonts.
          </p>
          <p>You must also change the values of the heading and paragraph font variables to the new font names for you
            to see the changes on your page. Replace the "IM Fell French Canon SC" value of --heading-font:</kbd> to
            your headline font. Remember if it has spaces in it, use quotes. Also change the 'Lato, Helvetica,
            sans-serif' value of
            <kbd>--paragraph-font:</kbd> as well to your paragraph font.</p>

          <h3>Color your fonts</h3>
          <p>
            Often you want your text to appear on a colored background. Let's
            pick some colors from your palette that will work well together.
          </p>
          <p>
            See if there are two colors in your scheme that can be used as
            text color or background color where the text remains readable (you
            need a high contrast between the colors). Black and white are
            always fair game even if they aren't in your color scheme. You can always visit <a
              href='https://contrast-ratio.com' target="_blank">contrast-ratio.com</a> to make sure your text and the
            background of the text have a passing ratio.
          </p>
          </p>
          <p>
            Switch to the <kbd>site-plan-rafting.css</kbd> file find the lines that look like this:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="lang-css">--headline-color-on-white: black;  /* headlines on a white background */ 
--headline-color-on-color: #FFFFFF; /* headlines on a colored background */ 
--paragraph-color-on-white: black; /* paragraph text on a white background */ 
--paragraph-color-on-color: #FFFFFF; /* paragraph text on a colored background */ 
--paragraph-background-color: #000000;</code></pre>
          <p>
            Change the <code>--paragraph-background-color</code> and then
            <code>--headline-color-on-color</code> and
            <code>--paragraph-color-on-color</code> values. If done correctly
            you should see an example of your colors together in the Preview
            of your page on Live Server. If any of the text is hard to read, then
            try different colors.
          </p>

          <h3>Style your navigation</h3>
          <p>
            Finally from your <em>color palette</em> choose the colors you
            would like to use for your navigational links (normal, hover,
            and backgrounds) and enter those colors in the
            <kbd>site-plan-rafting.css</kbd> file. Hover over the menu option to make sure the hover colors look good
            too.
          </p>
          <pre><code class="lang-css">--nav-link-color: #396E94;

          <h3>Site Map & Wireframes</h3>
          <p>
            Under the Navigation section under Site Map, you'll notice that there is a page called [Page2]. This will
            eventually be replaced with a more meaningful page name. Since we haven't decided on this page yet, you can
            leave that as it is for now. But later we will be adding a child page to our rafting site, and we can come
            back and change it then.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last section has a wireframe. The wireframe shows what the home page
            will look like, or in other words, how it will be laid out. We will not be changing
            anything in this area, just review it. In the following weeks, you will
            use the wireframe provided to help you to create the home page for
            the site. Later in the semester, you will create a wireframe
            for the child page.
