            <p>Estimated time: 60 minutes</p>
            <p>This week, we will continue with the webpage we started in the previous activities. Open up the
                <kbd>index.html</kbd>
                file from last week in your editor to begin.</p>


            <div class="callout">
                <p>We got all the content in our page last week, but you might have noticed it doesn't look too great.
                    Remember
                    that HTML is responsible to get content on a page, but to style it we use CSS.</p>
                <p>By the end of this activity, it won't look too much better, it will still take a few weeks before it
                    looks like the wireframe.</p>

                    <h3>Review Wireframe</h3>
                    <p>First, review the&nbsp;
                        <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/rafting_images/wireframe_home.png"
                            target="_blank">wireframe</a>&nbsp;again to help
                        remember
                        what we are trying to eventually do. Last week we added all of our content to our page, along
                        with some
                        extra
                        HTML to group up related content as necessary.</p>


                    <h2>Note</h2>
                    <p>At this point, do not expect your page to
                        <em>look</em> like the wireframe. We are laying a foundation, but have not learned how to
                        position
                        elements yet. Don't worry if your page does not look like the wireframe at the end of the
                        activity.</p>

                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Internal links</h3>
                    <p>Your page has <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags to link to your other internal web pages that belong to
                        your website. The <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element contains these links. You
                        will rename one of the pages later for the child pages that you will be completing.</p>

                    <p>It is often considered a good practice if you have a link that takes you away from the
                        current
                        site to have it open in a new window or tab. This can be done with the&nbsp;
                        <kbd>target="_blank"</kbd>&nbsp;attribute.</p>
                    <p>We will do that in the next step.</p>

                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>External links</h3>

                    <p>There are some external links in the footer to social media sites. In this case, it was
                        appropriate to make the
                        images
                        the link instead of text.</p>
                    <p>Make
                        sure the all the social media links open in a new window/tab of the browser with the
                        <kbd>target="_blank"</kbd>&nbsp;attribute added to the opening tag of each
                        <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>. Since these are external sites, it's good practice to open them in a new
                        tab.</p>

                    <p>We've been doing a lot with HTML so far. In fact, we have now added almost all the HTML we
                        will
                        need! I think it's about time we got to CSS!</p>

                    <p>We will use an external stylesheet.</p>
                    <p>We will add a line in your HTML that looks like this:</p>
                    <pre><code class="lang-markup">
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css"&gt;</code></pre>
                    <p>The
                        <kbd>link</kbd> tag tells the html file where to find the CSS it should use to style the page.
                        We
                        will enter all of our CSS in the
                        <kbd>style.css</kbd> file.
                        <p>Make sure the <kbd>link</kbd> element is in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section. </p>
                        <p>We now need to actually make this file called <kbd>style.css</kbd>. And from the path we see
                            that the css file will be inside the styles folder.</p>

                    <p>We will create a stylesheet inside the styles folder. Make sure you are on the Explorer icon in
                        Visual Studio and that your project is listed there. Select the styles folder and the 'New

                    <h3>Adding a container for our entire page</h3>
                    <p>There comes a point on larger monitors that our page will seem overwhelming with our large hero
                        image and other content. We need to set a <kbd>max-width</kbd> so when our page gets so big, it
                        will stop
                        growing in size. To do this, go back to the HTML document and we will need a container to target in CSS that we can give a
                        <kbd>max-width</kbd> to. Just add the new div element. You already have the other elements.</p>

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>
                    <p>The div will wrap around the entire page, or in other words, the entire contents of the body. The
                        opening <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag will be after the opening <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag and
                        close
                        before the closing <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag.</p>

                    <h3>Setting a width</h3>
                    <p>Apply a <kbd>width</kbd> to your whole page to keep it from stretching across the whole browser
                        window on
                        very large monitors by
                        making
                        a CSS rule for the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> we added in the last step with the id of
                        <kbd>content</kbd>. Go back to your CSS file. In the new rule we will add, let's set the <kbd>max-width</kbd> of the page to 1600px. Doing
                        it on that
                        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> will make sure that no element on the page can be wider than that.</p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>Why <kbd>max-width</kbd> instead of just <kbd>width</kbd> you may be asking yourself?
                            Setting
                            a <kbd>width</kbd> on an element will make it so that it is <b>always</b> that size. We never know
                            what
                            size of a screen someone might be looking at our page with...so forcing something to always
                            be
                            a size is a bit dangerous. The fact is that we don't care what size the content of our page
                            is,
                            as long as it's not <em>wider</em> than 1600px. It can certainly be narrower. Using
                            <kbd>max-width</kbd>
                            allows for that. Our page can be whatever size the screen...unless the screen is wider
                            than our limit...then it will stop
                            growing!

                    <p>Let's center our content. The
                        <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd> we set the <kbd>width</kbd> on, is a block element, that means we will
                        need to use
                        <kbd>margin</kbd> to center it. The idea is to set a <kbd>width</kbd> (we did this in the last
                        step), then
                        tell
                        the browser to take whatever <kbd>margin</kbd> is available and split it between the left and
                        right of the
                        element.
                        Add
                        <kbd>margin: 0 auto;</kbd> to the CSS rule for
                        <kbd>#content</kbd>. We gave it two values. The first says to set the top and bottom margins to 0
                        and
                        the second says to set the left and right margins to auto: meaning to split any
                        <kbd>margin</kbd>
                        available
                        between the left and right.
                    </p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>You may not see any difference when you set the <kbd>max-width</kbd> and center with
                            <kbd>margin:
                                0 auto</kbd>.
                            This is probably because the monitor you are using to view the page is not wider than
                            1600px. </p>
                        <p>This is why it's always important to view your page on many different types of devices. If
                            you want to take a quick look to see if it worked; you can zoom out of the browser page with
                            a Ctrl- (minus sign) until it's small enough to see the margins on either side. Use Ctrl+
                            (plus sign) to get it back to 100% zoom when you are done.</p>

                        message. Add a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element below the ending <code>&lt;/section&gt;</code>

                        of <kbd>height: 725px;</kbd>. Later we will be giving it a background color as well.</p>
                    <p>Here is an example:</p>
                    <pre><code class="lang-css">
#background {

                    <h3>Setting background colors</h3>
                    <p>Our next step is to add background colors to liven up our page a bit. The <kbd>background-color</kbd> property will set the background color of an element. Right now, the background colors default to transparent or whatever the background color of the parent element is. We want the following elements to stand out and have their own background colors.</p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>As you apply background colors and text colors make sure you pick colors with a good
                            contrast. Go to your site plan for colors that you had in mind for the site. Use
                            <kbd>background-color</kbd> for backgrounds and <kbd>color</kbd> for text or font colors.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Add <kbd>background-color</kbd> values to the following selectors:</p>
                    <kbd>body</kbd><br>
                    <kbd>header</kbd><br>
                    <kbd>nav a:hover</kbd><br>
                    <kbd>.book, .join</kbd><br>
                    <kbd>.book:hover, .join:hover</kbd><br>
                    <kbd>#background</kbd><br>
                    <kbd>.msg</kbd><br>
                    <kbd>footer</kbd>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <pre><code class="lang-css">
body {
    background-color: #fcfbfb; 
}
header {
    background-color:rgba(20,30,13, .7);
}
nav a:hover {
    background-color: black;
}
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>Think about using your own colors from your site plan.</p>
                    <p>A different shade of white was used for the background in this example. </p>
                    <p>An rgba was used in the example for the header because eventually we want to see the hero image
                        through the header, but you can choose what you want. You can always change it later.</p>
                    <p>These colors will need to have good contrast with the colors we set in the next step.</p>

                    <!-- END STEP -->
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Foreground colors</h3>
                    <p>The color you changed the backgrounds to, may make it hard to read the text in the foreground.
                        Use the
                        <kbd>color</kbd> property for the text. The <kbd>color</kbd> property always refers to the font color.</p>
                        <p>Again, replace the colors with those from your chosen palette in the site plan. Pick
                        something
                        that looks good with the background color and that is easily readable and has good contrast. You
                        can always use white or black if you need to.</p>
                    <p>Change the <kbd>color</kbd> property for all these selectors. If any selector already has a
                        rule-set, just
                        add the <kbd>color</kbd> declaration to it. Don't start a new rule-set.</p>

                    <h3>Add a Few Widths</h3>
                    <p>Let's add a few widths to some elements.</p>
                    <p>Add a <kbd>width</kbd> of 80px to the logo and each icon image that goes with the cards. I would
                        use the
                        <kbd>.logo</kbd> class as the selector for the logo, otherwise all your images might get that
                        <kbd>width</kbd>.</p>
                    <p>Use <kbd>.icon</kbd> as the selector for all the card icons.</p>
                    <p>Let's give a more responsive <kbd>width</kbd> to our hero image. Let's give it a <kbd>width</kbd>
                        of 100%. Again, use
                        the <kbd>#hero-img</kbd> selector so you don't affect any other images by mistake.</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <pre><code class="lang-css">
.icon {
    width: 80px;
}
                </code></pre>
                    <p>We will set more <kbd>width</kbd> in later weeks as we work with layout.</p>

                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Take off or add the default underline of links</h3>
                    <p>Underlines aren't always necessary with all links, especially the links we have that will
                        eventually look like buttons or with links that have a hover effect. We will take the underline
                        off with the <kbd>text-decoration</kbd> property and set it to a value of none. We will also add
                        the <kbd>underline</kbd> value to a hover as well.</p>
                    <p>Add the <kbd>text-decoration</kbd> property with a value of <kbd>none</kbd> to the following
                        selectors:</p>
                    <kbd>nav a</kbd><br>
                    <kbd>.book, .join</kbd><br>
                    <kbd>footer a</kbd><br>

                        <p>If you already have the selector targeted in your CSS file, just add the new declarations to
