        <p>So What is an Elevator pitch anyway?</p>
        <p>
          An elevator pitch is a brief, persuasive speech that you can use to
          spark interest in what you or your organization does. You can also
          use one to create interest in a project, idea, or product.
        </p>
        <p>It needs to be succinct while conveying important information.</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        The Final project for this class will be for you to create a website
        on a topic of your choice. We will start building this personal site
        soon. In order to prepare for that, we need to start planning
        now. Over the next few weeks as we continue learning more CSS and
        finish the Rafting site we will also be preparing a Site Plan for our
        final personal site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first step in the planning process is to determine the purpose of
        the site, so this week you need to settle on your idea for what you
        want to do. You should then create an elevator pitch for your personal
        site idea. Creating an elevator pitch can be a good gauge of the
        quality of your ideas and your enthusiasm for them.

          <h3>The 9 C's of elevator pitches</h3>
          <p>
            Review the 9 C's of an effective pitch from
            <a href="http://elevatorpitchessentials.com/essays/ElevatorPitch.html" target="_blank">Elevator Pitch
              Essentials</a>.
          </p>
          <dl class="def-list">
            <dt>Concise</dt>
            <dd>
              An effective elevator pitch contains as few words as possible,
              but no fewer.
            </dd>
            <dt>Clear</dt>
            <dd>
              Rather than being filled with acronyms, MBA-speak, and
              ten-dollar words, an effective elevator pitch can be understood
              by your grandparents, your spouse, and your children.
            </dd>

            <dt>Compelling</dt>
            <dd>
              An effective elevator pitch explains the problem your Solution
              solves.
            </dd>
            <dt>Credible</dt>
            <dd>
              An effective elevator pitch explains why you are qualified to
              see the problem and to build your Solution.
            </dd>
            <dt>Conceptual</dt>
            <dd>
              An effective elevator pitch stays at a fairly high level and
              does not go into too much unnecessary detail.
            </dd>
            <dt>Concrete</dt>
            <dd>
              As much as is possible, an effective elevator pitch is also
              specific and tangible.
            </dd>
            <dt>Customized</dt>
            <dd>
              An effective elevator pitch addresses the specific interests and
              concerns of the audience.
            </dd>
            <dt>Consistent</dt>
            <dd>
              Every version of an effective elevator pitch conveys the same
              basic message.
            </dd>
            <dt>Conversational</dt>
            <dd>
              Rather than being to close the deal, the goal of an elevator
              pitch is to just set the hook; to start a conversation, or
              dialogue, with the audience.

          <h3>Examples</h3>
          <p>
            Consider the following examples. Can you see the application of
            the 9C's in them?
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>“I work with Computers”</li>
            <li>“I’m a computer programmer”</li>
            <li>“I make mobile applications”</li>
            <li>
              "My company writes mobile device applications for other
              businesses."
            </li>
            <li>
              "My company develops mobile applications that businesses use to
              train their staff remotely. This results in a big increase in
              efficiency for an organization's managers."
            </li>
            <li>
              "Think about the last online purchase you made. Did you need any
              instructions to do it? Did everything go smoothly? That’s what I
              do… I make websites and online storefronts that look great and
              are so intuitive to use that people don’t need instructions or
              training to use them. I do this for a wide variety of
              businesses."
            </li>
          </ul>
          <!-- END STEP  -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Create a pitch for your website idea.</h3>
          <p>
            Create a 75-150 word pitch (about 60 seconds worth) for an idea
            that you would like to turn into a website. You can use the
            following process to help:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Identify your idea or goal.</li>
            <li>Explain what you want the website to do.</li>
            <li>Communicate your USP (Unique Selling Proposition).</li>
            <li>Engage with a question.</li>
            <li>Put it all together.</li>
            <li>Practice!</li>
          </ol>

          <!-- END STEP  -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Publish</h3>
          <p>
            Once you have put your pitch together and
            <strong>practiced</strong> it, share it with 3-4 people and get
            their feedback. These people can be anyone you think will give
            good feedback to you, but this sharing must be done synchronously!
            (face to face or video conference ideally). After sharing and
            getting feedback post your pitch and the feedback to the Elevator
            Pitch assignment.
