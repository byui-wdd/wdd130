      <h1>Your Personal Site Plan</h1>
      <hr />

      <p>
        Just as we did for the rafting site, before we build our personal
        (final) project, we need to do some planning. We started this project
        by preparing our purpose with the elevator pitch. This week we will begin a Site plan for the
        personal site we want to build that is very similar to the one we
        prepared for the rafting site.
      </p>
      <h2>Activity Directions</h2>
      <ol class="bigSteps">
        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Create a new folder for your new site</h3>
          <p>
            Let's start by adding a folder to the 'wdd130' folder. You can do this in file management or on Visual Studio Code.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Give this folder a name and remember this will be a part of the URL (web address), so keep it short, simple, and
            professional. The name should also have something to do with the topic of your personal site. This folder will be at the same level as our 'wwr' folder and will contain the new personal site project.
          </p>
          
        </li>
     
        <li>
          <h3>Add Site Plan Files</h3>
          <p>
            Add a file to your new folder called <kbd>site-plan.html</kbd>. The example here shows the new folder called 'dress4success'. Yours will, of course, have a different named folder. You also don't need a README.md file like is shown in the images if you don't choose to have one.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w07/new_file.png"
              alt="new site-plan.html file screen shot">
          </figure>
          <p>Go to: <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/site-plan-templates/site-plan-personal.html"
              target="_blank">Site Plan Template</a>, right-click on the page, and view the source code. (On Chrome it's
            the pop-up menu option 'View Page Source'.)</p>
          <p>
            Copy <strong>all</strong> the HTML code. You can use Cmd+A or Ctrl+A to select it all quickly, then copy it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paste the code into your <kbd>site-plan.html</kbd> page in VSCode and save the file.</p>
          <p>Create a new 'styles' folder. And create a <kbd>site-plan.css</kbd> file inside that folder.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w07/new_css.png"
              alt="new style folder and file screen shot">
          </figure>
          <p>Go to: <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/site-plan-templates/styles/site-plan.css"
              target="_blank">Site Plan CSS</a> and copy <strong>all</strong> the code.</p>
          <p>Paste the code into the <kbd>site-plan.css</kbd> file in VSCode and save it.</p>
          <p>
            As you look at the new site plan template, you will notice it is very
            similar to the last one. It does have a new section, however...Content.
            For the rafting site, you were provided with content, but you will need to
            generate all of the content (text and media) for your site.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will also be required to create three wireframes. One for each
            page of your site. Creating wireframes will be covered at a later time.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will have some activities designed to help you complete your site
            plan...but much of it you will need to do on your own. The completed
            site plan for your personal site is due at the end of
            <strong>Week 9</strong>. This gives you three weeks to complete it.
            <strong>Don't wait until the beginning of Week 9 to start!!</strong>

            of the URL web address and hit enter to get it to open.
          </p>
          Something like: your-account.github.io/wwd130/personal-folder/site-plan.html

            Your site plan should come up. Use that URL to submit.
