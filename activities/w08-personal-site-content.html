            <p>This week we will do an activity to help us generate the content we will need to complete our personal
                site.</p>

                <h2>Information about your personal site that might be helpful to know as you gather content. By the end
                    of this course:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Web site must consist of a home page and at least 2 child pages</li>
                    <li>The Web site must be hosted on the web.</li>
                    <li>Each page of your Web site must satisfy the following requirements:
                        <ol>
                            <li>

                                the meaning and
                                message of this site</li>

                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Brainstorm</h3>
                    <p>Over that last couple of weeks, you were asked to decide on a topic for your personal website and
                        create an elevator pitch 'selling' your idea. You should also have thought about your intended
                        audience. This week, begin by reviewing your pitch and audience, then think about three topics
                        your site will cover. Write those 3 topics down.</p>


                    <!-- END STEP  -->
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Write!</h3>
                    <p>With your topics and audience in mind, please write at least 600 words on your website idea
                        providing text content that your audience may want to read or get from your website. You can
                        just
                        free-write any pertinent information about your website idea following good paragraph and
                        sentence
                        structure, thought processes, etc. This content will be a rough draft in this week but will be
                        refined in subsequent weeks to become what the users will be reading from your website.
                        You may also consider answering some or all of the following questions about your website idea:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Why will people come to your site?</li>
                            <li>What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</li>
                            <li>What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?</li>
                            <li>What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?</li>
                            <li>Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or
                                complete the actions?</li>

                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <!-- END STEP  -->
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Organize</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Organize your paragraphs so there is "one idea per paragraph". This may involve breaking up
                            or otherwise editing paragraphs.</li>
                        <li>Name each paragraph by typing and bolding a paragraph-topic name for each paragraph. This
                            process can help you determine link names and additional topics that will be in your
                            website.</li>
                        <li>Organize your paragraphs by collecting and moving all the paragraphs that are "related" and
                            "alike" into respective areas along with their paragraph-topic names. For example, you
                            might have multiple paragraphs in your document pertaining to benefits of your website
                            idea. You should move all of those paragraphs (leaving the paragraph name) into the same
                            area of your document.</li>
                        <li>Finally, consider each set of related paragraphs. Identify a representative "main-topic"
                            title for each group. Each of these groups could become a page on your site. The
                            "main-topic" label you choose would become the link text for the page in the main
                            navigation. Remember that for our site we will have at least 3 pages. One of which will be
                            a form. So you should pick at 2-3 of your main-topics that you will use for your site. One
                            for
                            the home page, one for a child page, and possibly one for the page with a form (the
                            form can either be used to complete an action: order, post, update, etc. or to contact the
                            owner of the site).</li>
                    </ol>

                    <!-- END STEP  -->
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Images</h3>
                    <p>Images play a very large role in how we view and feel about websites. You should put some
                        thought into the images you will need to back up and enhance the content you generated above.

                    <p>For each of your pages, find 2-3 images that could be used to enhance the content of that page.
                        These can be images that you create yourself or images that you have found. If you find the
                        images online, make sure to honor copyright. Do not use images that are not stated as free to
                        use. Here are a couple of good sources for good, high quality, free stock images and icons.</p>
                    <p>Make sure to optimize
                        your images!</p>
