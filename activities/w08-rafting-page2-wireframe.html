          We now have a completed Home page, but if you review the site plan,
          you will remember that we had a second child page. We need to build that page. We
          have more work to do!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you refer back to our site plan, you will remember that there was
          a site map in there that had a 'Page2' link to the
          navigation bar that didn't currently exist. We need to design this page.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first step when designing is to put together a list of the
          elements that need to be on the page, then you can prioritize and
          start arranging those content elements together. This process of
          arranging is called wireframing. You were provided the wireframe for the
          home page. You will need to create one more wireframe now for
          another page.
        </p>
        <p>There are many good tools for creating wireframes. Many designers still start first by
          sketching on paper. You are welcome to do the same, or you can use
          one of the many programs that can let you do this. You could try
          <strong>PowerPoint</strong>, <strong>Word</strong>, or
          <strong>Paint</strong>, and most image editing software gives you the ability to create a wireframe.
          Or there are free online tools you could look at
          <a href="http://wireframe.cc/" target="_blank">wireframe.cc</a> or
          <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diagrams</a> or
          <a href="https://app.moqups.com/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moqups</a> or
          <a href="https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases" target="_blank">Drawio-Desktop</a><span>For this one you'd have to download the latest release from GitHub and install it locally on your computer.</span>. 
        You essentially
          just need something that allows you to place
          boxes and text and move them around easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do choose to just sketch on paper, you will need to take a
          picture or scan your drawings so you can include the images in your site plan when you turn that in. Make sure
          that your lines are dark enough that they can be easily seen in the
          image. If you use one of the online tools, you can either export your
          wireframe as an image if it has that option, or you could simply take
          a screenshot.
        </p>
        <h3>Note</h3>
        <p>
          To take a screenshot on a PC, press the
          <b>Print Screen</b> button on your keyboard (Sometimes called
          &ldquo;PrntScr&rdquo;) or use the Snippet tool. To take a screenshot on a Mac, press
          CMD-shift-4, then drag around the area you want the screenshot of.
          It will create an image file on your desktop.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the whole wireframe is hard to see, zoom out of the browser page with Ctrl- or Cmd- (that's Ctrl or Cmd
          with
          the minus key) so you can see the whole wireframe for the screenshot.

          <h3>Choose a page</h3>
          <p>
            In order to make a wireframe, we need to know what content we are using on our page. During preparations
            this week, you might have decided which content to use for your page when viewing the
            <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/resources/w08-subpage-content.html" target="_blank">Provided Page
              Content</a>,
            or you might have come up with your own content. Here is the link to the
            <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/resources/dryoarimages.html" target="_blank">images page</a>
            from earlier as well.</p>
            <p>You can modify the provided
              content or create your own. If you have another idea for a page
              (other than those listed) that would fit within the
              context of the site, feel free to do that instead.</p>
          
          <p>
            The page must include at least one image, in addition to a logo, enough text for the
            page to make sense and be able to stand on its own, and
            enough of the style elements from the home page that you can
              tell you are still on the same site
            (header, footer, navigation, font, colors, and so on).
          </p>

          <!--  BEGIN STEP  -->
          <h3>Create the Wireframe</h3>
          <p>Using a tool or pencil and paper make a
            wireframe for the page. 
          </p>
          <p>Begin the wireframe by adding all of the elements that should remain consistent between
            pages of the same site (such as header, navigation, and footer).</p> 
          <p>Look at the provided
            content to help you to know how to design the rest of the page. </p>
          </li>
          <p>Here are a few more suggestions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Keep in mind the design principles introduced. Ask
              yourself "How can I use the Elements of design (lines, color,
              texture, shape, size, and value) to implement the principles of
              design (Proximity, alignment, repetition, contrast) to make my
              page effective?"
            </li>
            <li>
              Make sure to let the user know clearly which page they are
              on. Every page should have a headline.
            </li>
            <li>
              Format the content! The content provided is not formatted. While
              making your wireframe, think about how you can make the content
              easier to read, scan, consume, and so on. Headlines, paragraphs, list,
              and so on should be used where appropriate. Make it something that
              <strong>you</strong> would actually read!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="callout">
            <p>
              You can use the <strong>actual content</strong> that you will have on
              the page in the wireframe. This will help you to get the
              size, shape, and placement of the text correct. For images, you
              can use a placeholder if you wish, but if you use the actual
              image, it is often easier to make decisions about size,
              shape, and placement than with a placeholder.
