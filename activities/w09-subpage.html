          <h3>Review Feedback</h3>
          <p>
            For this part of the project, make sure to review any feedback you
            have received on your rafting website and make any corrections or
            enhancements to make sure it looks and functions great. Make sure
            all images display and all links either work or do nothing. Make
            sure there are no spelling errors as well.

          <h3>Create the new HTML file</h3>
          <p>
            For this assignment, you will create the HTML for a sub-page from the wireframe that you completed last
            week. A sub-page is a page with links back and forth to your
            main page.
          </p>
          <div class="callout">
            <p>
              Want a shortcut? We know that many of the elements from our home
              page should also be on your child pages...header, navigation,
              footer, colors, etc. So, use the <kbd>index.html</kbd> as a
              starting point. Make a new file in your editor and save it with
              a meaningful name (for example, if I were making a rivers page, I
              would name my new file <kbd>rivers.html</kbd>)...then, copy and
              paste the code from your <kbd>index.html</kbd> into your new file, update
              the <kbd>&lt;title&gt;</kbd>, and delete the content that is
              specific to the home page (the hero div and everything inside of the main element) and Voila! You have a
              great start on
              your new page with the header and footer already done.
            </p>
            <h4>Note</h4>
            <p>
              You do not want to create a new .css file for this new page.
              This could create a problem of having pages look different in
              important ways because the styles in one file were updated and
              not the other. You should only have <strong>one</strong> .css
              file for your entire site. Add any new styles for this new HTML
              page beneath your home page CSS but before any media queries. Media queries are always at the very bottom. Use comments to indicate the start of the new page in CSS.
            </p>
            <h4>Another important note</h4>
            <p>
              Be careful about targeting generic elements like p, img, h2, etc. in your new subpage CSS. These rules could effect your home page too since they are in the same CSS file. This might be beneficial if you want all your h2's on your whole site to be the same. But it could also make a mess if you didn't mean to change your home page as you style the subpage. Make meaningful class and id names for elements that will be different from your home page elements. For example, instead of using 'home-grid' on your rivers page, use 'rivers-grid'.

          <h3>Add new content</h3>
          <p>
            Add the HTML necessary in your new page to contain the new
            content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pay attention to your wireframe and try to make the HTML represent
            your layout, ie. create boxes (sections or divs) to represent the
            rows and columns of your layout and to group related content
            together. Open your website into your browser to make sure the webpage
            displays correctly. Pay special attention to whether your
            images are all displaying. Once verified, begin adding the CSS to
            your site .css file to finish the page.

            submit the URL of this subpage to your site in
            ILearn.

        <h3>In the rubrics, you will notice that your page should be 'visually appealing'. What is meant by
          &ldquo;visually appealing?&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>
          I wish there was a non-subjective way to measure this... but there
          isn't. Generally, you only lose points for this with things that are
          obvious. For example, text that is difficult to read because it uses
          a color too similar to the background, a navigation bar that is
          directly against a banner or the text of the page rather than having
          some space around it, use of a color scheme that obviously indicates
          no thought was put into the color choices (this doesn't mean that
          you can't use white - it's more stating that if you just threw
          colors onto the page for the sake of throwing colors onto the page,
          and it is obvious, you'll lose points), etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you simply copy/pasted the text from the content page, in most
          cases it will <strong>not</strong> be visually appealing. Make sure
          that you format it to make it more readable! Be generous with
          <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags, padding, margins, and maybe even <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>s. You
          <strong>will</strong> lose points on this if you do not put some
          thought into the readability of the text.
        </p>
        <h3>What is considered &ldquo;significant content?&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>
          Each page of a website should clearly convey to the user what the
          page is for. If it is a main/home page, it should provide the user
          with enough information to know what your site is about, whether it
          contains the information/products they are looking for, and,
          thereby, whether they should stick around and keep looking through
          your website. As another example, if you have a "Contact Us" page,
          you usually need more than just a contact form/email address. The
          page should have enough information that the user knows what the
          contact form/email address is for, what happens when they contact
          you, what type of information you want the user to provide when
          contacting you, etc.
