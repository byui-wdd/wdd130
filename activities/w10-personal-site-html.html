            <h3>Home Page wireframe</h3>
            <p>
              Open the wireframe for your homepage first. You may even want to
              print it out and grab a marker and a ruler. We need to visualize
              any groups of content on the page and draw boxes around the
              groups. Each of these boxes should be represented as HTML in our
              page. <kbd>div, section, main, header, footer, nav</kbd>, etc
              elements should be used for this purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              Create an <kbd>index.html</kbd> file in your repository (folder containing your personal website)for your home page.

          <h3>Home Page wireframe</h3>
          <p>
            Open the wireframe for your homepage first. You may even want to
            print it out and grab a marker and a ruler. We need to visualize
            any groups of content on the page and draw boxes around the
            groups. Each of these boxes should be represented as HTML in our
            page. <kbd>div, section, main, header, footer, nav</kbd>, etc.
            elements should be used for this purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Create an <kbd>index.html</kbd> file in your repository, (folder containing your personal website), for your
            home page.
          </p>

          <h3>Home Page HTML and Content</h3>
          <p>
            Once you have identified any content groups on your wireframe,
            begin at the top left corner and start adding the elements
            necessary, then add the content for the home page.
          </p>
          <p>Add a link to your siteplan to the footer of the Home page.</p>

          <!-- END STEP -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Continue for page 2 and 3</h3>
          <p>
            Once you have the home page done, do the same exercise for pages
            two and three. The header and footer code should be very similar
            if not identical to the home page. Most of your changes should
            happen in the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should create a new HTML file for each page. Name them with
            something meaningful (but without any spaces or capitalization).
            You may even want to copy/paste the HTML from your
            <kbd>index.html</kbd> file as a starting point for these child
            pages. Just remember that while you will want to keep the code in
            the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and
            <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> (since it should be the same across
            all three pages), you should clear out the
            <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element when starting each new child
            page.
