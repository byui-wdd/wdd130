<h1>Your Own Wireframe</h1>

<h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
<p>Estimated Time: 45 minutes</p>
<div class="callout">
<p>We now have a completed web page, but if you review the syllabus, you will remember that our final website should consist of 3 or more pages. We have more work to do!</p>
<p>If you refer back to our site plan, you will remember that there was a site map in there, and in fact we added a full navigation bar to our site with links to pages that currently don't exist. You need to choose 2 of those links that you will now design and make a page for (or if you have other ideas for related pages you could go with those as well). I have put together some Subpage Content on the next page&nbsp;appropriate for each of those pages that you are welcome to use as is or modify, or you can come up with your own content for the page.</p>
<p>The first step when designing is to put together a list of the elements that need to be on the page, then you can prioritize and start arranging those content elements together. This process of arranging is called wireframing. I provided the wireframe for the first page, you will need to create 2 more wireframes now...one for each page.</p>
<p>There are lots of good resources online about wireframing like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-wireframing--webdesign-7399" target="_blank">Beginners guide to wireframing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWO2vlBHPvI" target="_blank">Youtube - Creating Wireframes</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wireframes.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">I &hearts; wireframes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>...and many good tools. Many designers still start first by sketching on paper...you are welcome to do the same, or you can use one of the many programs that can let you do this. You could try <strong>Powerpoint</strong>, <strong>Word</strong>, or <strong>Paint</strong>, most image editing software has the ability, or for free online tools you could look at <a href="http://wireframe.cc/" target="_blank">wireframe.cc</a> or <a href="https://app.moqups.com/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Moqups</a>. You essentially just need something that allows you to place boxes and text and move them around easily.</p>
<p>If you do choose to just sketch on paper you will need to take a picture or scan your drawings so you can turn them in. Make sure that your lines are dark enough that they can be easily seen in the image. If you use one of the online tools you can either export your wireframe as an image if it has that option or you could simply take a screenshot.</p>
<h3>Note</h3>
<p>To &ldquo;take a screenshot&rdquo; on a PC hit the &ldquo;printscreen&rdquo; button on your keyboard (Sometimes called &ldquo;prt scr&rdquo;, etc) Then you will need to paste it into something (Word for example) To take a scene shot on a mac hit CMD-shift-4. Then drag around the area you want the screenshot of. It will create an image file on your desktop.</p>
</div>
<h3>Step 01</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Choose 2 of the subpages from the site map that you will complete this semester along with the home page. Review the <a href="../resources/subpage_content.html" target="_blank">provided content</a>, or come up with your own list so that you have a good idea for what needs to be on the page. Here is the link to the <a href="../resources/dryoarimages.html" target="_blank">images page</a> from earlier as well.  Using a tool or pencil and paper make a wireframe for those pages. If you have another idea for a page (other than those listed in the sitemap) that would fit within the context of the site feel free to do that instead if you would rather.</span></p>
<p>Each page must include at least one image, enough text for the page to make sense and be able to stand on it&rsquo;s own, and <em>enough of the style elements from the home page that you can tell you are still on the same site</em> (header, footer, navigation, font, colors, etc).</p>
<p>Here are a few more suggestions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure to let the user know clearly which page they are on...headlines are your friend :)</li>
    <li>Format the content! The content provided is not formatted.  While making your wireframe think about how you can make the content easier to read, scan, consume, etc.  Headlines, paragraphs, list, etc should be used where appropriate.  Make it something that <strong>you</strong> would actually read!</li>
</ul>
<div class="callout">
    <p >Use the <strong>actual content</strong> that you will have on the page in the wireframe.&nbsp;This will help you to get the size, shape, and placement of the text correct. For images you can use a placeholder if you wish, but if you use the actual image it is often&nbsp;easier to make decisions about size, shape, and placement&nbsp;than with a placeholder.</p>
    <p>In case you missed it above...here are the links to the content and images again. You are welcome to use these or make or find you own content and images:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="../resources/subpage_content.html" target="_blank">provided content</a></li>
        <li><a href="../resources/dryoarimages.html" target="_blank">images page</a></li>
    </ul>
    </div>
<h3>Step 02</h3>
<!--<p>Go to the next page to access "W11.02 Your Own Wireframe" and click "Upload" to upload a word document with your purpose and audience statements.</p>-->
<p>Upload your wireframe images to ILearn</p>
<h4>Grading:</h4>
This activity will be graded using the following rubric:
<ul>
<li>Two wireframes are produced:</li>
<li>Each wireframe includes at least one image, significant text, and at least one headline. The wireframes include elements from the home page: header (navigation and logo) and footer, so the user will feel like they are still on the same site. (10 pts each)</li>
</ul>
