            We now have a completed web page, but if you review the site-plan,
            you will remember that we selected two child pages we were
            interested in, and that we need to build at least one of those. We
            have more work to do!
          </p>
          <p>
            If you refer back to our site plan, you will remember that there was
            a site map in there, and in fact you should have added links to the
            navigation bar to our site to pages that currently don't exist. I
            have put together some
            <a href="../resources/subpage_content.html" target="_blank"
              >Subpage Content</a
            >
            appropriate for each of those pages that you are welcome to use as
            is or modify, or you can come up with your own content for the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first step when designing is to put together a list of the
            elements that need to be on the page, then you can prioritize and
            start arranging those content elements together. This process of
            arranging is called wireframing. I provided the wireframe for the
            first page, you will need to create 2 more wireframes now...one for
            each page.
          </p>
          <p>There are lots of good resources online about wireframing like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a
                href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-wireframing--webdesign-7399"

                target="_blank"

              >
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="http://wireframes.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"
                >I &hearts; wireframes</a
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            ...and many good tools. Many designers still start first by
            sketching on paper...you are welcome to do the same, or you can use
            one of the many programs that can let you do this. You could try
            <strong>Powerpoint</strong>, <strong>Word</strong>, or
            <strong>Paint</strong>, most image editing software has the ability,
            or for free online tools you could look at
            <a href="http://wireframe.cc/" target="_blank">wireframe.cc</a> or
            <a
              href="https://app.moqups.com/login"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Moqups</a
            >. You essentially just need something that allows you to place
            boxes and text and move them around easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you do choose to just sketch on paper you will need to take a
            picture or scan your drawings so you can include the images in your site plan when you turn that in. Make sure
            that your lines are dark enough that they can be easily seen in the
            image. If you use one of the online tools you can either export your
            wireframe as an image if it has that option or you could simply take
            a screenshot.
          </p>
          <h3>Note</h3>
          <p>
            To &ldquo;take a screenshot&rdquo; on a PC hit the
            &ldquo;printscreen&rdquo; button on your keyboard (Sometimes called
            &ldquo;prt scr&rdquo;, etc) Then you will need to paste it into
            something (Word for example). To take a scene shot on a mac hit
            CMD-shift-4. Then drag around the area you want the screenshot of.
            It will create an image file on your desktop.

            <h3>Review the Principles of Design</h3>
            <p>
              Begin by reviewing these resources about the
              <a href="../resources/design-principles.html" target="_blank"
                >principles of good design</a
              >
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <!--  BEGIN STEP  -->
            <h3>Choose a page</h3>
            <p>
              Review your site plan to see which pages you had chosen to
              complete. Choose one of them to create your first wireframe for
              (or another if you want...it's ok to change your mind). Review the
              <a href="../resources/subpage_content.html" target="_blank"
                >provided content</a
              >, or come up with your own list so that you have a good idea for
              what needs to be on the page. Here is the link to the
              <a href="../resources/dryoarimages.html" target="_blank"
                >images page</a
              >
              from earlier as well. Using a tool or pencil and paper make a
              wireframe for those pages. If you have another idea for a page
              (other than those listed in the sitemap) that would fit within the
              context of the site feel free to do that instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each page must include at least one image, enough text for the
              page to make sense and be able to stand on its own, and
              <em
                >enough of the style elements from the home page that you can
                tell you are still on the same site</em
              >
              (header, footer, navigation, font, colors, etc).
            </p>
            <p>Here are a few more suggestions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Keep in mind the design principles introduced in step 1. Ask
                yourself "How can I use the Elements of design (lines, color,
                texture, shape, size, and value) to implement the principles of
                design (Proximity, alignment, repetition, contrast) to make my
                page effective?"
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure to let the user know clearly which page they are
                on...headlines are your friend :)
              </li>
              <li>
                Format the content! The content provided is not formatted. While
                making your wireframe think about how you can make the content
                easier to read, scan, consume, etc. Headlines, paragraphs, list,
                etc should be used where appropriate. Make it something that
                <strong>you</strong> would actually read!
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                Use the <strong>actual content</strong> that you will have on
                the page in the wireframe.&nbsp;This will help you to get the
                size, shape, and placement of the text correct. For images you
                can use a placeholder if you wish, but if you use the actual
                image it is often&nbsp;easier to make decisions about size,
                shape, and placement&nbsp;than with a placeholder.

                and images again. You are welcome to use these or make or find
                you own content and images:

              you chose.

          <h4>Grading:</h4>
          This activity will be graded using the following rubric:
          <ul>
            <li>Two wireframes are produced:</li>
            <li>
              Each wireframe includes at least one image, significant text, and
              at least one headline. The wireframes include elements from the
              home page: header (navigation and logo) and footer, so the user
              will feel like they are still on the same site. (10 pts each)
