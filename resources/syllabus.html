        <h1>WDD 130: Web Fundamentals Syllabus</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Welcome to WDD 130! This class serves as an introduction to Web design
          and development. The course is designed to introduce students to
          basics of Web technology, Web design and development principles. The
          course uses hands-on activities with students actually participating
          in simple Web design projects and programming. It is anticipated that
          students who complete this course will understand the fields of Web
          design and development and will have a good idea of whether or not
          they want to pursue Web design and development as a career.
        </p>
        <h2>Time Consumption</h2>
        <p>
          Remember, because this is a two-credit course, you will spend
          approximately 4-6 hours each week doing the homework. Do not plan
          otherwise. The most important thing to remember is to pace yourself.
          Set aside time throughout the week to complete your assignments.
        </p>
        <h2>Text</h2>
        <p>
          <em>There is no textbook for this course. </em>However, because many
          of the readings and assignments are online, students are recommended
          to have a steady internet connection.
        </p>

        <h2>Standards and Generative AI use</h2>
        <p>
          Be responsible for your own education. Take responsibility to complete
          your homework as assigned. Be prepared to accept the consequences if
          you do not. It is important that you finish assignments and turn them
          in on time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in this course is not forbidden. But the majority of your use of AI in this course is to use it as a tutor, not to write code for you. All projects that are turned in for points in the course should be your own code and not copying code given to you by AI.
