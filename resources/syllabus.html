            <h1>WDD 130: Web Fundamentals Syllabus</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Welcome to WDD 130! This class serves as an introduction to Web design and development. The course is designed
                to introduce students to basics of Web technology, Web design and development principles. The course uses
                hands-on activities with students actually participating in simple Web design projects and programming. It
                is anticipated that students who complete this course will understand the fields of Web design and development
                and will have a good idea of whether or not they want to pursue Web design and development as a career.</p>
            <h2>Time Consumption</h2>
            <p>Remember, because this is a two-credit course, you will spend approximately 4-6 hours each week doing the homework.
                Do not plan otherwise. The most important thing to remember is to pace yourself. Set aside time throughout
                the week to complete your assignments.</p>
            <h2>Text</h2>
            <p>
                <em>There is no textbook for this course. </em>However, because many of the readings and assignments are online,
                students are recommended to have a steady internet connection.</p>
            <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
            <p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Demonstrate basic proficiency in using current, valid, and semantic Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) syntax
                    to define the structure and content of a webpage.</li>
                <li>Demonstrate basic proficiency in using current valid Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to style an HTML document.</li>
                <li>Plan, design, and develop web pages and sites according to best practices of organization and maintainability.</li>
                <li>Discover and analyze the web design and development industry as a career path.</li>
                <li>Work effectively with others by communicating clearly, collaborating as a team member, fulfilling assignments
                    and meeting deadlines.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Caution/Schedule</h2>
            <p>Schedules, assignments, and policies are subject to change. You will be given notification of any changes; check
                I-Learn and email frequently. You should check the course schedule each day to determine when things are
                due.
            </p>
            <h2>Homework</h2>
            <p>There will be weekly assignments due over the course of the semester. Many of these exercises build off of each
                other. It is important that you do not fall behind. Pay attention to Ilearn for the specific dates and times.
                There are three important dates associated to each activity or assignment:&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The start date: The date the activity begins</li>
                <li>The due date: The date the activity is due.</li>
                <li>The end date: The date the activity locks and no submission will be allowed after that.</li>
            </ul>
            *Please note:&nbsp; Activities are not accepted via email.&nbsp; You must submit your activities in the correct place and
            within the posted timeframe.

            <h2>ILearn</h2>
            <p>All of the activity instructions and assignments can be found in Ilearn. Make sure to spend some time learning
                how to make the most of Ilearn. Submitting assignments, checking your progress in the course and knowing
                how to see feedback from the instructor are all crucial things to know. Here are a couple of links you should
                check out if you are unsure about any of these things.</p>
