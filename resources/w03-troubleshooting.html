            <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
            <h2>IT'S NOT WORKING!!!!</h2>
            <p>Not sure if you can relate to the headline above...but what should you do if nothing you try seems to
                work?</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Validate your HTML! Because HTML is a standard, programs can be written to check for errors or
                    poorly
                    written code. Whenever things aren't working the way the activity says they should, and you can't
                    find the reason ... you should validate.
                    <p class="callout">Validating is easy. Go to <a href="https://validator.w3.org/"
                            target="_blank">https://validator.w3.org/</a>,
                        then enter in the same url that you would submit in iLearn for your site. It will check for any
                        HTML
                        errors and tell you where they are. Don't panic if it comes back with some really high number.
                        One
                        error can often cascade and create many others. I recommend fixing the first, then re-validating
                        until all are gone.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Validate your CSS! There is also a CSS standard, so you can validate that as well to check for
                    errors.
                    The process is similar, you just need to go to a different site. The CSS validator can be found at:
                    <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/"
                        target="_blank">https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/</a>.
                    Follow the same steps...fix the first error then re-validate until clean.</li>
                <li>Communicate with classmates and the instructor. If you are spending multiple hours on any activity,
                    you
                    are most likely stuck! Get in touch with someone that can help and have them look at your code.</li>
                <li>I can't stress this enough. <strong>Don't wait too long to get help!</strong> Everything we do
                    builds
                    on what we have done before. Don't let yourself get behind because one or two early concepts aren't
                    making
                    sense and you didn't ask for help!</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Practice: HTML Validation</h2>
            <ol>
                <p> Click on <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/resources/w03-dryoar-index-errors.html"
                        target="_blank">this link</a>, then right-click
                    and select "Show Page source" or "View Source". This should show you the code that makes the page.
                    (If
                    you are in Edge and you don't see the View Source option try typing ctrl-u...or switch to Chrome :)
                    ).
                    Click inside the window that shows the code and select it all (cmd-a on Mac, ctrl-a on Windows) and
                    copy the
                    contents (cmd/ctrl-c). Go to your project and create a new file. Call it
                    <kbd>troubleshooting.html</kbd> and
                    paste the code into it (cmd/ctrl-v).</li>
                    <li>Select all the code again and copy it. Visit <a href="https://validator.w3.org/"
                            target="_blank">https://validator.w3.org/</a>
                        and and select the "Validate by Direct Input" tab. Paste your HTML code into the box. Hit
                        "Check" </li>
                    <li>You should see a list of several errors that are in the HTML of that file. Find and correct all
                        of the
                        errors. Help each other out! Each time you fix errors in your editor you will need to copy the
                        code in
                        the editor and paste them into the box in the validator.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with the top of the list and work down. Often fixing one issue will resolve multiple errors.
                </li>
                <li>As you fix an error copy/paste the corrected code into the validator and re-check.</li>
                <li>Remember that an Element is: an opening tag, closing tag, and everything in between. Look at this
                    example:
                    <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;nav&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Home&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Contact Us&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;</code></pre>
                    <p>The entire block of code is a "nav element" since everything is inside of the opening and closing
                        <code>nav</code> tags. <code>&lt;li&gt;Home&lt;/li&gt;</code> is also an element and would be
                        called
                        a "li element". </p>
                </li>
                <li>Elements are often nested (placed inside of each other).</li>
                <li>An element inside of another element would be considered a <em>child</em> of the parent element.
                    Referring
                    to our example above, The <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements are the <em>children</em> of the
                    <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element,
                    and the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element is the <em>child</em> of the
                    <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element.</li>
                <li>Note that the validator will tell you the line and column where it found the error. Use this as a
                    starting
                    point when searching out the issues.</li>
