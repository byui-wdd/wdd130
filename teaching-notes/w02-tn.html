        <h1>Week 02 - Planning</h1>
        <hr />

        <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Remind students that they should have already finished the
            preparation videos and/or reading assignment and quiz before the
            first class of the week. You can give them a grace day if they
            forgot, but encourage them to get that done for the first class each
            week. This ensures they are ready to jump into the hands-on
            exercises in class. The videos and/or reading is listed on the
            'Prepare' section in each week on Canvas.
          </li>
          <li>
            This week we set up the hosting environment with GitHub Pages. This
            involves downloading Git on their local computers and getting a
            GitHub account. They will link up Visual Studio Code with their
            account so they can Push their files to their GitHub repository.
            This can be quite complicated for beginning 100 level students. Take
            an entire day to step them through this carefully.
          </li>
          <li>
            The site plan for the white water rafting site will also be started
            this week.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The following link contains what instructors can step students through
            during one day or more of this week. The link is what online students would use instead of going through it with an instructor.

        <ul>
          <li>
            You can have them practice with new CSS concepts this week by doing something together in class. Here is a continuation of last week's page that you can use to  <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/activities/w02-css-intro-practice.html" target="_blank">practice CSS</a>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            Students will also be starting the planning for a website for a
            fictional whitewater rafting company. They will be asked to put
            themselves in the shoes of the owners of the company this week and
            to ask themselves two questions: "What is the purpose of having a
            website built for my company?" and "Who is the audience of my
            website?" The aim of these questions is to get students to think
            about the importance of determining a purpose before working on
            anything else. Websites are all about delivering content; however,
            not all parts of a page are equal. The purpose and audience
            determine what content needs to be in the site and also which
            content gets the highest priority.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            The students will also be asked to pick style elements like colors
            and font for their version of the site. They will put this all
            together in a site plan. The site plan template is provided as an
            html and css code they will copy into their own files. Make sure to
            look over the site plan to see how it is constructed.
