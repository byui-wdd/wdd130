      <h1>Week 03 - Creating the Home page</h1>
      <hr />

      <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This week, the students will write about 90% of the HTML for the home page for the rafting site.&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W03 Quiz: Preparation</h3>
        <li>Remind students that they should finished the
          preparation videos and/or reading assignment and quiz at the
          first of the week. This ensures they are ready to jump into the hands-on
          exercises. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Even if some 'Ponder' assignments are not graded, encourage the students to carefully complete them. They will need the skills covered for 'Prove' assignments.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
      <ul>
        <h3>W03 Classes and ID Practice</h3>
        <li>Students can practice with classes and ids by adding to the web page they have practiced with in the last few weeks by following this <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/activities/w03-classes-ids-practice.html">Classes and IDs Practice Example</a></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W03 Working with Wireframes</h3>
        <li>The Site plan template contains a wireframe that we will be using this week. &nbsp;Stress two things to
          the students: first, the assignment will make much more sense if they refer to the wireframe often while
          reading the instructions, and second their page will <strong>NOT </strong>look like the wireframe at the end
          of this week. We will have all of the content represented there on our page, but it will be weeks before our
          page looks just like the wireframe.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>With this assignment, the student practice taking a wireframe and making HTML code using the
          wireframe. They will be using the
          wireframe from <a class="inline_disabled"
            href="https://dribbble.com/shots/978949-Responsive-Wireframe-Templates-GIF/attachments/113429"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">dribbble.com</a> They will view this follow-up video to the one they watch in preparation explaining what you might do in class after studying the groupings of a wireframe:</li>

      <ul>
        <h3>W03 Troubleshooting</h3>
        <li>The 'Troubleshooting with Validation' is a good exercise for students to introduce them to validation.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W03 Frontend Developer</h3>
        <li>The Web Frontend Developer information is our first in a series of web career exploration information. You can require a report from
          your students if you want.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W03 Assignment: HTML for the Home Page</h3>
        <li>Students will be stepped through adding the HTML to their home page with this assignment. Stress to them that they must follow the directions carefully. They are given code many times in these type of assignments but sometimes (especially in future weeks) they are required to come up with the code on their own and if they are not reading carefully they will miss these steps.</li>
        <li>Students will also add images to their home page. They are given images to use, but are also welcome to add their own images. If they want different images I would refer them to the collection of rafting images that we have already gathered for this course at: <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/resources/dryoarimages.html">Alternative small, medium, and larger rafting iamges and logos</a> They are already optimized.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure to stress the importance of completing the Troubleshooting and Wireframe activities as well. They
          are ungraded, but important that they understand.</li>
        <li>Help the students understand constructive versus destructive criticism. The criticism needs to be valid and
          concrete</li>
        <li>Make sure you are available to students through office hours and make responses within 24 hours</li>
        <li>Check the Course <span>Questions and Conversations</span>
          <span>&nbsp;Discussion Board</span>
        </li>
